# Xamarin.Forms and Azure Cognitive Services

## [Introduction](introduction.md)

Microsoft Cognitive Services are a set of APIs, SDKs, and services available to developers to make their applications more intelligent by adding features such as facial recognition, speech recognition, and language understanding. This article provides an introduction to the sample application that demonstrates how to invoke some of the Microsoft Cognitive Service APIs from Xamarin.Forms applications.

## [Speech Recognition](speech-recognition.md)

The Microsoft Speech API is a cloud-based API that provides algorithms to process spoken language. This article explains how to use the Microsoft Speech Recognition REST API to convert audio to text in a Xamarin.Forms application.

## [Spell Check](spell-check.md)

Bing Spell Check performs contextual spell checking for text, providing inline suggestions for misspelled words. This article explains how to use the Bing Spell Check REST API to correct spelling errors in a Xamarin.Forms application.

## [Text Translation](text-translation.md)

The Microsoft Translator API can be used to translate speech and text through a REST API. This article explains how to use the Microsoft Translator Text API to translate text from one language to another in a Xamarin.Forms application.

## [Perceived Emotion Recognition](emotion-recognition.md)

The Face API takes a facial expression in an image as an input, and returns data that includes confidence levels across a set of emotions for each face in the image. This article explains how to use the Face API to recognize emotion, to rate a Xamarin.Forms application.

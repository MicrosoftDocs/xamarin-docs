# Xamarin.Forms Frequently Asked Questions

## [Can I update the Xamarin.Forms default template to a newer NuGet package?](update-forms-template.md)
This guide uses the Xamarin.Forms .NET Standard library template as an example, but the same general method will also work for the Xamarin.Forms Shared Project template.

## [Why doesn't the Visual Studio XAML designer work for Xamarin.Forms XAML files?](forms-xaml-designer.md)
Xamarin.Forms doesn't currently support visual designers for XAML files.

## [Android build error: The "LinkAssemblies" task failed unexpectedly](android-linkassemblies-error.md)
You may see an error message `The "LinkAssemblies" task failed unexpectedly` when building a Xamarin.Android project that uses Forms. This happens when the linker is active (typically on a *Release* build to reduce the size of the app package); and it occurs because the Android targets aren't updated to the latest framework.

## ["Why does my Xamarin.Forms.Maps Android project fail with COMPILETODALVIK : UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL ERROR?"](maps-compiletodalvik-error.md)
This error may be seen in the Error pad of Visual Studio for Mac or in the Build Output window of Visual Studio; in Android projects using Xamarin.Forms.Maps. It is most commonly resolved by increasing the Java Heap Size for your Xamarin.Android project.

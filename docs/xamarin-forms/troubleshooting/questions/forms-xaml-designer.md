# Why doesn't the Visual Studio XAML designer work for Xamarin.Forms XAML files?

Xamarin.Forms doesn't currently support visual designers for XAML files. Because of this, when trying to open a Forms XAML file in either Visual Studio's *XAML UI Designer* or *XAML UI Designer with Encoding*, the following error message is thrown:

> "The file cannot be opened with the selected editor. Please choose another editor."

This limitation is described in the [Xamarin.Forms XAML Basics](~/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/index.md) guide:

> "There is not yet a visual designer for generating XAML in Xamarin.Forms applications, so all XAML must be hand-written."

However, the Xamarin.Forms XAML Previewer can be displayed by selecting the **View > Other Windows > Xamarin.Forms Previewer** menu option.

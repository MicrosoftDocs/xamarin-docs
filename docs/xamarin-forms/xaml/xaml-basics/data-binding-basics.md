# Part 4. Data Binding Basics

_Data bindings allow properties of two objects to be linked so that a change in one causes a change in the other. This is a very valuable tool, and while data bindings can be defined entirely in code, XAML provides shortcuts and convenience. Consequently, one of the most important markup extensions in Xamarin.Forms is Binding._

## Data Bindings

Data bindings connect properties of two objects, called the *source* and the *target*. In code, two steps are required: The `BindingContext` property of the target object must be set to the source object, and the `SetBinding` method (often used in conjunction with the `Binding` class) must be called on the target object to bind a property of that object to a property of the source object.

The target property must be a bindable property, which means that the target object must derive from `BindableObject`. The online Xamarin.Forms documentation indicates which properties are bindable properties. A property of `Label` such as `Text` is associated with the bindable property `TextProperty`.

In markup, you must also perform the same two steps that are required in code, except that the `Binding` markup extension takes the place of the `SetBinding` call and the `Binding` class.

However, when you define data bindings in XAML, there are multiple ways to set the `BindingContext` of the target object. Sometimes it’s set from the code-behind file, sometimes using a `StaticResource` or `x:Static` markup extension, and sometimes as the content of `BindingContext` property-element tags.

Bindings are used most often to connect the visuals of a program with an underlying data model, usually in a realization of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) application architecture, as discussed in [Part 5. From Data Bindings to MVVM](~/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data-bindings-to-mvvm.md), but other scenarios are possible.

## View-to-View Bindings

You can define data bindings to link properties of two views on the same page. In this case, you set the `BindingContext` of the target object using the `x:Reference` markup extension.

Here’s a XAML file that contains a `Slider` and two `Label` views, one of which is rotated by the `Slider` value and another which displays the `Slider` value:

```xaml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             x:Class="XamlSamples.SliderBindingsPage"
             Title="Slider Bindings Page">

    <StackLayout>
        <Label Text="ROTATION"
               BindingContext="{x:Reference Name=slider}"
               Rotation="{Binding Path=Value}"
               FontAttributes="Bold"
               FontSize="Large"
               HorizontalOptions="Center"
               VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand" />

        <Slider x:Name="slider"
                Maximum="360"
                VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand" />

        <Label BindingContext="{x:Reference slider}"
               Text="{Binding Value, StringFormat='The angle is {0:F0} degrees'}"
               FontAttributes="Bold"
               FontSize="Large"
               HorizontalOptions="Center"
               VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand" />
    </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```

The `Slider` contains an `x:Name` attribute that is referenced by the two `Label` views using the `x:Reference` markup extension.

The `x:Reference` binding extension defines a property named `Name` to set to the name of the referenced element, in this case `slider`. However, the `ReferenceExtension` class that defines the `x:Reference` markup extension also defines a `ContentProperty` attribute for `Name`, which means that it isn’t explicitly required. Just for variety, the first `x:Reference` includes “Name=” but the second does not:

```csharp
BindingContext="{x:Reference Name=slider}"
…
BindingContext="{x:Reference slider}"
```

The `Binding` markup extension itself can have several properties, just like the `BindingBase` and `Binding` class. The `ContentProperty` for `Binding` is `Path`, but the “Path=” part of the markup extension can be omitted if the path is the first item in the `Binding` markup extension. The first example has “Path=” but the second example omits it:

```csharp
Rotation="{Binding Path=Value}"
…
Text="{Binding Value, StringFormat='The angle is {0:F0} degrees'}"
```

The properties can all be on one line or separated into multiple lines:

```csharp
Text="{Binding Value, 
               StringFormat='The angle is {0:F0} degrees'}"
```

Do whatever is convenient.

Notice the `StringFormat` property in the second `Binding` markup extension. In Xamarin.Forms, bindings do not perform any implicit type conversions, and if you need to display a non-string object as a string you must provide a type converter or use `StringFormat`. Behind the scenes, the static `String.Format` method is used to implement `StringFormat`. That’s potentially a problem, because .NET formatting specifications involve curly braces, which are also used to delimit markup extensions. This creates a risk of confusing the XAML parser. To avoid that, put the entire formatting string in single quotation marks:

```csharp
Text="{Binding Value, StringFormat='The angle is {0:F0} degrees'}"
```

Here’s the running program:

[![](data-binding-basics-images/sliderbinding.png "View-to-View Bindings")](data-binding-basics-images/sliderbinding-large.png#lightbox "View-to-View Bindings ")

## The Binding Mode 

A single view can have data bindings on several of its properties. However, each view can have only one `BindingContext`, so multiple data bindings on that view must all reference properties of the same object.

The solution to this and other problems involves the `Mode` property, which is set to a member of the `BindingMode` enumeration:

- `Default` 
- `OneWay` — values are transferred from the source to the target
- `OneWayToSource` — values are transferred from the target to the source
- `TwoWay` — values are transferred both ways between source and target

The following program demonstrates one common use of the `OneWayToSource` and `TwoWay` binding modes. Four `Slider` views are intended to control the `Scale`, `Rotate`, `RotateX`, and `RotateY` properties of a `Label`. At first, it seems as if these four properties of the `Label` should be data-binding targets because each is being set by a `Slider`. However, the `BindingContext` of `Label` can be only one object, and there are four different sliders.

For that reason, all the bindings are set in seemingly backwards ways: The `BindingContext` of each of the four sliders is set to the `Label`, and the bindings are set on the `Value` properties of the sliders. By using the `OneWayToSource` and `TwoWay` modes, these `Value` properties can set the source properties, which are the `Scale`, `Rotate`, `RotateX`, and `RotateY` properties of the `Label`:

        <Label BindingContext="{x:Reference rotationXSlider}"
               Text="{Binding Value, StringFormat='RotationX = {0:F0}'}"
               Grid.Row="3" Grid.Column="1"
               VerticalTextAlignment="Center" />

        <!-- Slider and identifying Label for RotationY -->
        <Slider x:Name="rotationYSlider"
                BindingContext="{x:Reference label}"
                Grid.Row="4" Grid.Column="0"
                Maximum="360"
                Value="{Binding RotationY, Mode=OneWayToSource}" />

        <Label BindingContext="{x:Reference rotationYSlider}"
               Text="{Binding Value, StringFormat='RotationY = {0:F0}'}"
               Grid.Row="4" Grid.Column="1"
               VerticalTextAlignment="Center" />
    </Grid>
</ContentPage>
```

The bindings on three of the `Slider` views are `OneWayToSource`, meaning that the `Slider` value causes a change in the property of its `BindingContext`, which is the `Label` named `label`. These three `Slider` views cause changes to the `Rotate`, `RotateX`, and `RotateY` properties of the `Label`.

However, the binding for the `Scale` property is `TwoWay`. This is because the `Scale` property has a default value of 1, and using a `TwoWay` binding causes the `Slider` initial value to be set at 1 rather than 0. If that binding were `OneWayToSource`, the `Scale` property would initially be set to 0 from the `Slider` default value. The `Label` would not be visible, and that might cause some confusion to the user.

## Bindings and Collections

Nothing illustrates the power of XAML and data bindings better than a templated `ListView`.

`ListView` defines an `ItemsSource` property of type `IEnumerable`, and it displays the items in that collection. These items can be objects of any type. By default, `ListView` uses the `ToString` method of each item to display that item. Sometimes this is just what you want, but in many cases, `ToString` returns only the fully-qualified class name of the object.

However, the items in the `ListView` collection can be displayed any way you want through the use of a *template*, which involves a class that derives from `Cell`. The template is cloned for every item in the `ListView`, and data bindings that have been set on the template are transferred to the individual clones.

Very often, you’ll want to create a custom cell for these items using the `ViewCell` class. This process is somewhat messy in code, but in XAML it becomes very straightforward.

Included in the XamlSamples project is a class called `NamedColor`. Each `NamedColor` object has `Name` and `FriendlyName` properties of type `string`, and a `Color` property of type `Color`. In addition, `NamedColor` has 141 static read-only fields of type `Color` corresponding to the colors defined in the Xamarin.Forms `Color` class. A static constructor creates an `IEnumerable<NamedColor>` collection that contains `NamedColor` objects corresponding to these static fields, and assigns it to its public static `All` property.

Setting the static `NamedColor.All` property to the `ItemsSource` of a `ListView` is easy using the `x:Static` markup extension:

```xaml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:local="clr-namespace:XamlSamples;assembly=XamlSamples"
             x:Class="XamlSamples.ListViewDemoPage"
             Title="ListView Demo Page">

    <ListView ItemsSource="{x:Static local:NamedColor.All}" />

</ContentPage>
```

The resultant display establishes that the items are truly of type `XamlSamples.NamedColor`:

[![](data-binding-basics-images/listview1.png "Binding to a Collection")](data-binding-basics-images/listview1-large.png#lightbox "Binding to a Collection")

It’s not much information, but the `ListView` is scrollable and selectable.

To define a template for the items, you’ll want to break out the `ItemTemplate` property as a property element, and set it to a `DataTemplate`, which then references a `ViewCell`. To the `View` property of the `ViewCell` you can define a layout of one or more views to display each item. Here’s a simple example:

```xaml
<ListView ItemsSource="{x:Static local:NamedColor.All}">
    <ListView.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <ViewCell>
                <ViewCell.View>
                    <Label Text="{Binding FriendlyName}" />
                </ViewCell.View>
            </ViewCell>
        </DataTemplate>
    </ListView.ItemTemplate>
</ListView>
```

The `Label` element is set to the `View` property of the `ViewCell`. (The `ViewCell.View` tags are not needed because the `View` property is the content property of `ViewCell`.) This markup displays the `FriendlyName` property of each `NamedColor` object:

[![](data-binding-basics-images/listview2.png "Binding to a Collection with a DataTemplate")](data-binding-basics-images/listview2-large.png#lightbox "Binding to a Collection with a DataTemplate")

Much better. Now all that’s needed is to spruce up the item template with more information and the actual color. To support this template, some values and objects have been defined in the page’s resource dictionary:

```xaml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:local="clr-namespace:XamlSamples"
             x:Class="XamlSamples.ListViewDemoPage"
             Title="ListView Demo Page">

    <ContentPage.Resources>
        <ResourceDictionary>
            <OnPlatform x:Key="boxSize"
                        x:TypeArguments="x:Double">
                <On Platform="iOS, Android, UWP" Value="50" />
            </OnPlatform>

            <OnPlatform x:Key="rowHeight"
                        x:TypeArguments="x:Int32">
                <On Platform="iOS, Android, UWP" Value="60" />
            </OnPlatform>

            <local:DoubleToIntConverter x:Key="intConverter" />

        </ResourceDictionary>
    </ContentPage.Resources>

    <ListView ItemsSource="{x:Static local:NamedColor.All}"
              RowHeight="{StaticResource rowHeight}">
        <ListView.ItemTemplate>
            <DataTemplate>
                <ViewCell>
                    <StackLayout Padding="5, 5, 0, 5"
                                 Orientation="Horizontal"
                                 Spacing="15">

                        <BoxView WidthRequest="{StaticResource boxSize}"
                                 HeightRequest="{StaticResource boxSize}"
                                 Color="{Binding Color}" />

                        <StackLayout Padding="5, 0, 0, 0"
                                     VerticalOptions="Center">

                            <Label Text="{Binding FriendlyName}"
                                   FontAttributes="Bold"
                                   FontSize="Medium" />

                            <StackLayout Orientation="Horizontal"
                                         Spacing="0">
                                <Label Text="{Binding Color.R,
                                       Converter={StaticResource intConverter},
                                       ConverterParameter=255,
                                       StringFormat='R={0:X2}'}" />

                                <Label Text="{Binding Color.G,
                                       Converter={StaticResource intConverter},
                                       ConverterParameter=255,
                                       StringFormat=', G={0:X2}'}" />

                                <Label Text="{Binding Color.B,
                                       Converter={StaticResource intConverter},
                                       ConverterParameter=255,
                                       StringFormat=', B={0:X2}'}" />
                            </StackLayout>
                        </StackLayout>
                    </StackLayout>
                </ViewCell>
            </DataTemplate>
        </ListView.ItemTemplate>
    </ListView>
</ContentPage>
```

Notice the use of `OnPlatform` to define the size of a `BoxView` and the height of the `ListView` rows. Although the values for all three platforms are the same, the markup could easily be adapted for other values to fine-tune the display. 

## Binding Value Converters

The previous **ListView Demo** XAML file displays the individual `R`, `G`, and `B` properties of the Xamarin.Forms `Color` structure. These properties are of type `double` and range from 0 to 1. If you want to display the hexadecimal values, you can’t simply use `StringFormat` with an “X2” formatting specification. That only works for integers and besides, the `double` values need to be multiplied by 255.

This little problem was solved with a *value converter*, also called a *binding converter*. This is a class that implements the `IValueConverter` interface, which means it has two methods named `Convert` and `ConvertBack`. The `Convert` method is called when a value is transferred from source to target; the `ConvertBack` method is called for transfers from target to source in `OneWayToSource` or `TwoWay` bindings:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Globalization;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace XamlSamples
{
    class DoubleToIntConverter : IValueConverter
    {
        public object Convert(object value, Type targetType,
                              object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
        {
            double multiplier;

            if (!Double.TryParse(parameter as string, out multiplier))
                multiplier = 1;

            return (int)Math.Round(multiplier * (double)value);
        }

        public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType,
                                  object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
        {
            double divider;

            if (!Double.TryParse(parameter as string, out divider))
                divider = 1;

            return ((double)(int)value) / divider;
        }
    }
}
```

The `ConvertBack` method does not play a role in this program because the bindings are only one way from source to target. 

A binding references a binding converter with the `Converter` property. A binding converter can also accept a parameter specified with the `ConverterParameter` property. For some versatility, this is how the multiplier is specified. The binding converter checks the converter parameter for a valid `double` value.

The converter is instantiated in the resource dictionary so it can be shared among multiple bindings:

```xaml
<local:DoubleToIntConverter x:Key="intConverter" />
```

Three data bindings reference this single instance. Notice that the `Binding` markup extension contains an embedded `StaticResource` markup extension:

```xaml
<Label Text="{Binding Color.R,
                      Converter={StaticResource intConverter},
                      ConverterParameter=255,
                      StringFormat='R={0:X2}'}" />
```

Here’s the result:

[![](data-binding-basics-images/listview3.png "Binding to a Collection with a DataTemplate and Converters")](data-binding-basics-images/listview3-large.png#lightbox "Binding to a Collection with a DataTemplate and Converters")

The `ListView` is quite sophisticated in handling changes that might dynamically occur in the underlying data, but only if you take certain steps. If the collection of items assigned to the `ItemsSource` property of the `ListView` changes during runtime—that is, if items can be added to or removed from the collection—use an `ObservableCollection` class for these items. `ObservableCollection` implements the `INotifyCollectionChanged` interface, and `ListView` will install a handler for the `CollectionChanged` event.

If properties of the items themselves change during runtime, then the items in the collection should implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface and signal changes to property values using the `PropertyChanged` event. This is demonstrated in the next part of this series, [Part 5. From Data Binding to MVVM](~/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data-bindings-to-mvvm.md).

## Summary

Data bindings provide a powerful mechanism for linking properties between two objects within a page, or between visual objects and underlying data. But when the application begins working with data sources, a popular application architectural pattern begins to emerge as a useful paradigm. This is covered in [Part 5. From Data Bindings to MVVM](~/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data-bindings-to-mvvm.md).

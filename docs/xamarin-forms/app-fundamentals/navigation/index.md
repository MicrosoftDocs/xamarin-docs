# Xamarin.Forms Navigation

_Xamarin.Forms provides a number of different page navigation experiences, depending upon the Page type being used._

![](images/page-types.png "Xamarin.Forms Page Types")

## [Hierarchical Navigation](hierarchical.md)

The [`NavigationPage`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.NavigationPage) class provides a hierarchical navigation experience where the user is able to navigate through pages, forwards and backwards, as desired. The class implements navigation as a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack of [`Page`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page) objects.

## [TabbedPage](tabbed-page.md)

The Xamarin.Forms [`TabbedPage`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TabbedPage) consists of a list of tabs and a larger detail area, with each tab loading content into the detail area.

## [CarouselPage](carousel-page.md)

The Xamarin.Forms [`CarouselPage`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselPage) is a page that users can swipe from side to side to navigate through pages of content, like a gallery.

## [MasterDetailPage](master-detail-page.md)

The Xamarin.Forms [`MasterDetailPage`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterDetailPage) is a page that manages two pages of related information â€“ a master page that presents items, and a detail page that presents details about items on the master page.

## [Modal Pages](modal.md)

Xamarin.Forms also provides support for modal pages. A modal page encourages users to complete a self-contained task that cannot be navigated away from until the task is completed or cancelled.

# Behaviors

_Behaviors lets you add functionality to user interface controls without having to subclass them. Behaviors are written in code and added to controls in XAML or code._

## [Introduction to Behaviors](introduction.md)

Behaviors enable you to implement code that you would normally have to write as code-behind, because it directly interacts with the API of the control in such a way that it can be concisely attached to the control. This article provides an introduction to behaviors.

## [Attached Behaviors](attached.md)

Attached behaviors are `static` classes with one or more attached properties. This article demonstrates how to create and consume attached behaviors.

## [Xamarin.Forms Behaviors](creating.md)

Xamarin.Forms behaviors are created by deriving from the [`Behavior`](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Xamarin.Forms.Behavior/) or [`Behavior<T>`](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Xamarin.Forms.Behavior%3CT%3E/) class. This article demonstrates how to create and consume Xamarin.Forms behaviors.

## [Reusable Behaviors](reusable/index.md)

Behaviors are reusable across more than one application. These articles explain how to create useful behaviors to perform commonly used functionality.

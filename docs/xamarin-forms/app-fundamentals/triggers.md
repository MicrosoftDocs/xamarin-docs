# Xamarin.Forms Triggers

Triggers allow
    you to express actions declaratively in XAML that
    change the appearance of controls based on events
    or property changes.

You can assign a trigger directly to a control, or add it to
    a page-level or app-level resource dictionary to be applied
    to multiple controls.

There are four types of trigger:

* [Property Trigger](#property) - occurs when a property on a control
    is set to a particular value.

* [Data Trigger](#data) - uses data binding to trigger based on
    the properties of another control.

* [Event Trigger](#event) - occurs when an event occurs on the control.

* [Multi Trigger](#multi) - allows multiple trigger conditions to be
    set before an action occurs.

## Property Triggers

A simple trigger can be expressed purely in XAML, adding
    a `Trigger` element to a control's triggers collection.
    This example shows a trigger that changes an `Entry`
    background color when it receives focus:

```xaml
<Entry Placeholder="enter name">
    <Entry.Triggers>
        <Trigger TargetType="Entry"
             Property="IsFocused" Value="True">
            <Setter Property="BackgroundColor" Value="Yellow" />
        </Trigger>
    </Entry.Triggers>
</Entry>
```

The important parts of the trigger's declaration are:

* **TargetType** - the control type that the trigger applies to.

* **Property** - the property on the control that is monitored.

* **Value** - the value, when it occurs for the monitored property,
    that causes the trigger to activate.

* **Setter** - a collection of `Setter` elements can be added
    and when the trigger condition is met. You must specify
    the `Property` and `Value` to set.

* **EnterActions and ExitActions** (not shown) - are written in
    code and can be used in
    addition to (or instead of) `Setter` elements. They
    are [described below](#enterexit).

### Applying a Trigger using a Style

Triggers can also be added to a `Style` declaration
    on a control, in a page, or an application `ResourceDictionary`. This
    example declares an implicit style (ie. no `Key` is
    set) which means it will apply to all `Entry` controls
    on the page.

```xaml
<ContentPage.Resources>
    <ResourceDictionary>
        <Style TargetType="Entry">
                        <Style.Triggers>
                <Trigger TargetType="Entry"
                         Property="IsFocused" Value="True">
                    <Setter Property="BackgroundColor" Value="Yellow" />
                </Trigger>
            </Style.Triggers>
        </Style>
    </ResourceDictionary>
</ContentPage.Resources>
```

<a name="data" />

## Data Triggers

Data triggers use data binding to monitor another control
    to cause the `Setter`s to get called. Instead of
    the `Property` attribute in a property trigger, set the
    `Binding` attribute to monitor for the
    specified value.

The example below uses the data binding syntax
    `{Binding Source={x:Reference entry}, Path=Text.Length}`
    which is how we refer to another control's properties. When the
    length of the `entry` is zero, the trigger is activated. In this
    sample the trigger disables the button when the input is empty.

```xaml
<!-- the x:Name is referenced below in DataTrigger-->
<!-- tip: make sure to set the Text="" (or some other default) -->
<Entry x:Name="entry"
       Text=""
       Placeholder="required field" />

<Button x:Name="button" Text="Save"
        FontSize="Large"
        HorizontalOptions="Center">
    <Button.Triggers>
        <DataTrigger TargetType="Button"
                     Binding="{Binding Source={x:Reference entry},
                                       Path=Text.Length}"
                     Value="0">
            <Setter Property="IsEnabled" Value="False" />
        </DataTrigger>
    </Button.Triggers>
</Button>
```

Tip: when evaluating `Path=Text.Length` always provide a
    default value for the target property (eg. `Text=""`)
    because otherwise it will be `null` and the trigger
    won't work like you expect.

In addition to specifying `Setter`s you can also provide
    [`EnterActions` and `ExitActions`](#enterexit).

<a name="event" />

## Event Triggers

The `EventTrigger` element
    requires only an `Event` property, such as `"Clicked"`
    in the example below.

```xaml
<EventTrigger Event="Clicked">
    <local:NumericValidationTriggerAction />
</EventTrigger>
```

Notice that there are no `Setter` elements but rather
    a reference to a class defined by `local:NumericValidationTriggerAction`
    which requires the `xmlns:local` to be declared in
    the page's XAML:

```xaml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WorkingWithTriggers;assembly=WorkingWithTriggers"
```

The class itself implements `TriggerAction` which means it should
    provide an override for the `Invoke` method that is called
    whenever the trigger event occurs.

A trigger action implementation should:

* Implement the generic `TriggerAction<T>` class, with the generic
    parameter corresponding with the type of control the trigger
    will be applied to. You can use superclasses such as `VisualElement`
    to write trigger actions that work with a variety of controls,
    or specify a control type like `Entry`.

* Override the `Invoke` method - this is called whenever the trigger
    criteria are met.

* Optionally expose properties that can be set in the XAML
    when the trigger is declared (such as `Anchor`, `Scale`, and
    `Length` in this example).

```csharp
public class NumericValidationTriggerAction : TriggerAction<Entry>
{
    protected override void Invoke (Entry entry)
    {
        double result;
        bool isValid = Double.TryParse (entry.Text, out result);
        entry.TextColor = isValid ? Color.Default : Color.Red;
    }
}
```

The properties exposed by the trigger action can be set
    in the XAML declaration as follows:

```xaml
<EventTrigger Event="TextChanged">
    <local:NumericValidationTriggerAction />
</EventTrigger>
```

Be careful when sharing triggers in a `ResourceDictionary`,
    one instance will be shared among controls so any state
    that is configured once will apply to them all.

Note that event triggers do not support `EnterActions`
    and `ExitActions`    [described below](#enterexit).

<a name="multi" />

## Multi Triggers

A `MultiTrigger` looks similar to a `Trigger` or `DataTrigger`
    except there can be more than one condition. All the conditions
    must be true before the `Setter`s are triggered.

Here's an example of a trigger for a button that binds to
    two different inputs (`email` and `phone`):

```xaml
<MultiTrigger TargetType="Button">
    <MultiTrigger.Conditions>
        <BindingCondition Binding="{Binding Source={x:Reference email},
                                   Path=Text.Length}"
                               Value="0" />
        <BindingCondition Binding="{Binding Source={x:Reference phone},
                                   Path=Text.Length}"
                               Value="0" />
    </MultiTrigger.Conditions>

  <Setter Property="IsEnabled" Value="False" />
    <!-- multiple Setter elements are allowed -->
</MultiTrigger>
```

The `Conditions` collection could also contain
    `PropertyCondition` elements like this:

```xaml
<PropertyCondition Property="Text" Value="OK" />
```

### Building a "require all" multi trigger

The multi trigger only updates its control when all conditions
    are true. Testing for "all field lengths are zero" (such as
    a login page where all inputs must be complete) is tricky
    because you want a condition "where Text.Length > 0" but
    this can't be expressed in XAML.

This can be done with an `IValueConverter`. The converter
    code below transforms the `Text.Length` binding into a
    `bool` that indicates whether a field is empty or not:

```csharp
public class MultiTriggerConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType,
        object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        if ((int)value > 0) // length > 0 ?
            return true;            // some data has been entered
        else
            return false;            // input is empty
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType,
        object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        throw new NotSupportedException ();
    }
}
```

To use this converter in a multi trigger, first add it
    to the page's resource dictionary (along with a custom
    `xmlns:local` namespace definition):

```xaml
<ResourceDictionary>
   <local:MultiTriggerConverter x:Key="dataHasBeenEntered" />
</ResourceDictionary>
```

The XAML is shown below. Note the following differences
    from the first multi trigger example:

* The button has `IsEnabled="false"` set by default.
* The multi trigger conditions use the converter to
    turn the `Text.Length` value into a `boolean`.
* When all the conditions are `true`, the setter
    makes the button's `IsEnabled` property `true`.

```xaml
<Entry x:Name="user" Text="" Placeholder="user name" />

<Entry x:Name="pwd" Text="" Placeholder="password" />

<Button x:Name="loginButton" Text="Login"
        FontSize="Large"
        HorizontalOptions="Center"
        IsEnabled="false">
  <Button.Triggers>
    <MultiTrigger TargetType="Button">
      <MultiTrigger.Conditions>
        <BindingCondition Binding="{Binding Source={x:Reference user},
                              Path=Text.Length,
                              Converter={StaticResource dataHasBeenEntered}}"
                          Value="true" />
        <BindingCondition Binding="{Binding Source={x:Reference pwd},
                              Path=Text.Length,
                              Converter={StaticResource dataHasBeenEntered}}"
                          Value="true" />
      </MultiTrigger.Conditions>
      <Setter Property="IsEnabled" Value="True" />
    </MultiTrigger>
  </Button.Triggers>
</Button>
```

These screenshots show the difference between the two multi
    trigger examples above. In the top part of the screens, text input in
    just one `Entry` is enough to enable the **Save** button.
    In the bottom part of the screens, the **Login** button
    remains inactive until both fields contain data.

## EnterActions and ExitActions

Another way to implement changes when a trigger occurs
    is by adding `EnterActions` and `ExitActions` collections
    and specifying `TriggerAction<T>` implementations.

You can provide *both* `EnterActions` and `ExitActions` as
    well as `Setter`s in a trigger, but be aware that the `Setter`s
    are called immediately (they do not wait for the `EnterAction`
    or `ExitAction` to complete). Alternatively you can perform
    everything in the code and not use `Setter`s at all.

```xaml
<Entry Placeholder="enter job title">
    <Entry.Triggers>
        <Trigger TargetType="Entry"
                 Property="Entry.IsFocused" Value="True">
            <Trigger.EnterActions>
                <local:FadeTriggerAction StartsFrom="0"" />
            </Trigger.EnterActions>

            <Trigger.ExitActions>
                <local:FadeTriggerAction StartsFrom="1" />
            </Trigger.ExitActions>
                        <!-- You can use both Enter/Exit and Setter together if required -->
        </Trigger>
    </Entry.Triggers>
</Entry>
```

As always, when a class is referenced in XAML you should
    declare a namespace such as `xmlns:local` as shown here:

```xaml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WorkingWithTriggers;assembly=WorkingWithTriggers"
```

The `FadeTriggerAction` code is shown below:

```csharp
public class FadeTriggerAction : TriggerAction<VisualElement>
{
    public FadeTriggerAction() {}

    public int StartsFrom { set; get; }

    protected override void Invoke (VisualElement visual)
    {
            visual.Animate("", new Animation( (d)=>{
                var val = StartsFrom==1 ? d : 1-d;
                visual.BackgroundColor = Color.FromRgb(1, val, 1);

            }),
            length:1000, // milliseconds
            easing: Easing.Linear);
    }
}
```

Note: `EnterActions` and `ExitActions` are ignored on
    **Event Triggers**.

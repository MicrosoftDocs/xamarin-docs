# Xamarin.Forms Shell

## [Introduction](introduction.md)

Xamarin.Forms Shell reduces the complexity of mobile application development by providing the fundamental features that most mobile applications require. This includes a common navigation user experience, a URI-based navigation scheme, and an integrated search handler.

## [Create a Xamarin.Forms Shell application](create.md)

The process for creating a Xamarin.Forms Shell application is to create a XAML file that subclasses the `Shell` class, set the `MainPage` property of the application's `App` class to the subclassed `Shell` object, and then describe the visual hierarchy of the application in the subclassed `Shell` class.

## [Flyout](flyout.md)

The flyout is the root menu for a Shell application, and is accessible through an icon or by swiping from the side of the screen. The flyout consists of an optional header, flyout items, and optional menu items.

## [Tabs](tabs.md)

After a flyout, the next level of navigation in a Shell application is the bottom tab bar. Alternatively, the navigation pattern for an application can begin with bottom tabs and make no use of a flyout. In both cases, when a bottom tab contains more than one page, the pages will be navigable by top tabs.

## [Page configuration](configuration.md)

The `Shell` class defines attached properties that can be used to configure the appearance of pages in Xamarin.Forms Shell applications. This includes setting page colors, disabling the navigation bar, disabling the tab bar, and displaying views in the navigation bar.

## [Navigation](navigation.md)

Shell applications can utilize a URI-based navigation scheme that uses routes to navigate to any page in the application, without having to follow a set navigation hierarchy.

## [Search](search.md)

Shell applications can use integrated search functionality that's provided by a search box that can be added to the top of each page.

## [Custom renderers](customrenderers.md)

Shell applications are highly customizable through the properties and methods that the various Shell classes expose. However, it's also possible to create a Shell custom renderer when more sophisticated platform-specific customizations are required.

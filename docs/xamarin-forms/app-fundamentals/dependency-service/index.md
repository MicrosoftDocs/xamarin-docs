_Xamarin.Forms allows developers to define behavior in platform-specific projects. DependencyService then finds the right platform implementation, allowing shared code to access the native functionality._

This guide is composed of the following articles:

- **[Introduction](introduction.md)** &ndash; introduces the overall architecture of the `DependencyService` concept.
- **[Implementing Text-to-Speech](text-to-speech.md)** &ndash; walks through an example of using each platform's native text-to-speech system.
- **[Checking Device Orientation](device-orientation.md)** &ndash; walks through an example of using native platform APIs to determine the device's orientation.
- **[Getting Battery Information](battery-info.md)** &ndash; walks through an example of using native APIs to get information on the battery's status.
- **[Picking a Photo from the Library](photo-picker.md)** &ndash; walks through an example of using native APIs to pick a photo from the phone's picture library.

# Xamarin.Forms Requirements

_Platform and development system requirements for Xamarin.Forms._

Refer to the [Installation](~/cross-platform/get-started/installation/index.md) article for an overview of installation and setup practices that apply across platforms.

## Target platforms

Xamarin.Forms applications can be written for the following operating systems:

- iOS 8 or higher
- Android 4.4 (API 19) or higher ([more details](#android))
- Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform ([more details](#windows10))

It is assumed that developers have familiarity with [.NET Standard](~/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/net-standard.md) and [Shared Projects](~/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/shared-projects.md).

### Additional platform support

The status of these platforms is available on the [Xamarin.Forms GitHub](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/wiki/Platform-Support):

- Samsung Tizen
- macOS
- GTK#
- WPF

### Platforms from earlier versions

These platforms are not supported when using Xamarin.Forms 3.0:

- *Windows 8.1 / Windows Phone 8.1 WinRT*
- *Windows Phone 8 Silverlight*

### Android

You should have the latest Android SDK Tools and Android API platform installed. You can update to the latest versions using the [Android SDK Manager](~/android/get-started/installation/android-sdk.md).

Additionally, the target/compile version for Android projects **must** be set to *Use latest installed platform*. However the minimum version can be set to API 19 so you can continue to support devices
that use Android 4.4 and newer. These values are set in the **Project Options**:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/vswin)

**Project Options > Application > Application Properties**

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/vsmac)

## Development system requirements

Xamarin.Forms apps can be developed on macOS and Windows. However, Windows and Visual Studio are required to produce Windows versions of the app.

## Mac System requirements

You can use Visual Studio for Mac to develop Xamarin.Forms apps on OS X El Capitan (10.11) or newer. To develop iOS apps, we recommend having at least the iOS 10 SDK and Xcode 8 installed.

> [!NOTE]
>  Windows apps cannot be developed on macOS.

## Windows system requirements

Xamarin.Forms apps for iOS and Android can be built on any Windows installation that supports Xamarin development. This requires Visual Studio 2017 or newer running on Windows 7 or higher. A networked Mac is required for iOS development.

### Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

Developing Xamarin.Forms apps for UWP requires:

- Windows 10 (Fall Creators Update recommended)

- Visual Studio 2017

- [Windows 10 SDK](https://dev.windows.com/downloads/windows-10-sdk)

UWP projects are included in Xamarin.Forms solutions created in Visual Studio 2017,
but not solutions created in Visual Studio for Mac.
You can [add a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) App](~/xamarin-forms/platform/windows/installation/index.md) to an existing
Xamarin.Forms solution at any time.

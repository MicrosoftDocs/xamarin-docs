# Xamarin Hot Restart (Preview)

![Preview feature](~/media/shared/preview.png)

Xamarin Hot Restart enables you to quickly test changes to your app during development, including multi-file code edits, resources, and references. It pushes the new changes to the existing app bundle on the debug target which results in a much faster build and deploy cycle.

> [!NOTE]
> Xamarin Hot Restart is currently available in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.5 Preview and supports iOS apps using Xamarin.Forms. Support for Visual Studio for Mac and non-Xamarin.Forms apps is on the roadmap.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 version 16.5 Preview 2 or newer
- iTunes (64-bit)
- Apple Developer account


## Initial setup

1. Ensure the iOS project is set as the startup project and the build configuration set to **Debug|iPhone**.

   1. If this is an existing project, go to **Build > Configuration Managerâ€¦** and ensure **Deploy** is enabled for the iOS project.

2. Select and click **Local Device** in the toolbar to launch the setup wizard:

3. If iTunes is not installed, click **Download iTunes** to download the installer. Click **Next** when the iTunes installation is complete.

4. Connect an iOS device to your machine. The device name will appear in the wizard once it is detected. Click **Next**.

5. Enter your Apple Developer account credentials and click **Next**.

6. Select a development team using the dropdown menu in order to enable [automatic provisioning](~/ios/get-started/installation/device-provisioning/automatic-provisioning.md) in the project. Click **Finish**.

> [!NOTE]
> Using automatic provisioning is recommended so additional iOS devices can be easily configured for deployment. However, you can disable it and continue using manual provisioning if the correct provisioning profiles are present.

## Use Xamarin Hot Restart
After the initial setup, your connected device will appear in the debug target dropdown menu. To debug your app, select your device in the dropdown and click the **Run** button. You may see a message in Visual Studio asking you to manually launch the app on the device in order to start the debug session.

You can make edits to your code files while debugging, then press the **Restart** button in the debug toolbar or use **Ctrl+Shift+F5** to restart the debug session with your new changes applied:

## Limitations
- Only iOS apps built with Xamarin.Forms and iOS devices are currently supported.
- Storyboard and XIB files are not supported and the app may crash if it attempts to load these at runtime. If you are using these in your app, please let us know as we are interested in this supporting this scenario in the future.
- Static iOS libraries and frameworks are not supported. You may see runtime errors or crashes if your app attempts to load these. However, dynamic iOS libraries are supported.
- You cannot use Xamarin Hot Restart to create app bundles for publishing. You will still need a Mac machine to do a full compilation, signing, and deployment for your application to production.

## Troubleshoot
- The setup wizard will not detect iTunes if it was installed via the Microsoft Store. You will need to uninstall that version first then download the [installer from Apple](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2101014).
- There is a known issue where having device-specific builds enabled prevents the app from entering debug mode. Workaround is to disable this under **Properties > iOS Build** and retry debugging. This will be fixed in a future release.
- If the app is already present on the device, trying to deploy with Hot Restart may fail with a `AMDeviceStartHouseArrestService` error. The workaround is to uninstall the app on the device then deploy again.

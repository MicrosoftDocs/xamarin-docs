# Xamarin.Forms CarouselView Interaction

[![Download Sample](~/media/shared/download.png) Download the sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/userinterface-carouselviewdemos/)

[`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) defines the following properties that control user interaction:

- `CurrentItem`, of type `object`, the current item being displayed. This property has a default binding mode of `TwoWay`, and has a `null` value when there isn't any data to display.
- `CurrentItemChangedCommand`, of type `ICommand`, which is executed when the current item changes.
- `CurrentItemChangedCommandParameter`, of type `object`, which is the parameter that's passed to the `CurrentItemChangedCommand`.
- `IsBounceEnabled`, of type `bool`, which specifies whether the `CarouselView` will bounce at a content boundary. The default value is `true`.
- `IsSwipeEnabled`, of type `bool`, which determines whether a swipe gesture will change the displayed item. The default value is `true`.
- `Position`, of type `int`, the index of the current item in the underlying collection. This property has a default binding mode of `TwoWay`, and has a 0 value when there isn't any data to display.
- `PositionChangedCommand`, of type `ICommand`, which is executed when the position changes.
- `PositionChangedCommandParameter`, of type `object`, which is the parameter that's passed to the `PositionChangedCommand`.

All of these properties are backed by [`BindableProperty`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty) objects, which means that the properties can be targets of data bindings.

[`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) defines a `CurrentItemChanged` event that's fired when the `CurrentItem` property changes, either due to user scrolling, or when an application sets the property. The `CurrentItemChangedEventArgs` object that accompanies the `CurrentItemChanged` event has two properties, both of type `object`:

- `PreviousItem` – the previous item, after the property change.
- `CurrentItem` – the current item, after the property change.

[`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) also defines a `PositionChanged` event that's fired when the `Position` property changes, either due to user scrolling, or when an application sets the property. The `PositionChangedEventArgs` object that accompanies the `PositionChanged` event has two properties, both of type `int`:

- `PreviousPosition` – the previous position, after the property change.
- `CurrentPosition` – the current position, after the property change.

## Respond to the current item changing

When the currently displayed item changes, the `CurrentItem` property will be set to the value of the item. When this property changes, the `CurrentItemChangedCommand` is executed with the value of the `CurrentItemChangedCommandParameter` being passed to the `ICommand`. The `Position` property is then updated, and the `CurrentItemChanged` event fires.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Position` property changes when the `CurrentItem` property changes. This will result in the `PositionChangedCommand` being executed, and the `PositionChanged` event firing.

### Event

The following XAML example shows a [`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) that uses an event handler to respond to the current item changing:

```xaml
<CarouselView ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
              CurrentItemChanged="OnCurrentItemChanged">
    ...
</CarouselView>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CarouselView carouselView = new CarouselView();
carouselView.SetBinding(ItemsView.ItemsSourceProperty, "Monkeys");
carouselView.CurrentItemChanged += OnCurrentItemChanged;
```

In this example, the `OnCurrentItemChanged` event handler is executed when the `CurrentItemChanged` event fires, with the event handler exposing the previous and current items:

```csharp
void OnCurrentItemChanged(object sender, CurrentItemChangedEventArgs e)
{
    Monkey previousItem = e.PreviousItem as Monkey;
    Monkey currentItem = e.CurrentItem as Monkey;
}
```

### Command

The following XAML example shows a [`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) that uses a command to respond to the current item changing:

```xaml
<CarouselView ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
              CurrentItemChangedCommand="{Binding ItemChangedCommand}"
              CurrentItemChangedCommandParameter="{Binding Source={RelativeSource Self}, Path=CurrentItem}">
    ...
</CarouselView>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CarouselView carouselView = new CarouselView();
carouselView.SetBinding(ItemsView.ItemsSourceProperty, "Monkeys");
carouselView.SetBinding(CarouselView.CurrentItemChangedCommandProperty, "ItemChangedCommand");
carouselView.SetBinding(CarouselView.CurrentItemChangedCommandParameterProperty, new Binding("CurrentItem", source: RelativeBindingSource.Self));
```

In this example, the `CurrentItemChangedCommand` property binds to the `ItemChangedCommand` property, passing the `CurrentItem` property value to it as an argument. The `ItemChangedCommand` can then respond to the current item changing, as required:

```csharp
public ICommand ItemChangedCommand => new Command<Monkey>((item) =>
{
    PreviousMonkey = CurrentMonkey;
    CurrentMonkey = item;
});
```

In this example, the `ItemChangedCommand` updates objects that store the previous and current items.

## Respond to the position changing

When the currently displayed item changes, the `Position` property will be set to the index of the current item in the underlying collection. When this property changes, the `PositionChangedCommand` is executed with the value of the `PositionChangedCommandParameter` being passed to the `ICommand`. The `PositionChanged` event then fires. If the `Position` property has been programmatically changed, the [`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) will be scrolled to the item that corresponds to the `Position` value.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the `Position` property to 0 will result in the first item in the underlying collection being displayed.

### Event

The following XAML example shows a [`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) that uses an event handler to respond to the `Position` property changing:

```xaml
<CarouselView ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
              PositionChanged="OnPositionChanged">
    ...
</CarouselView>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CarouselView carouselView = new CarouselView();
carouselView.SetBinding(ItemsView.ItemsSourceProperty, "Monkeys");
carouselView.PositionChanged += OnPositionChanged;
```

In this example, the `OnPositionChanged` event handler is executed when the `PositionChanged` event fires, with the event handler exposing the previous and current positions:

```csharp
void OnPositionChanged(object sender, PositionChangedEventArgs e)
{
    int previousItemPosition = e.PreviousPosition;
    int currentItemPosition = e.CurrentPosition;
}
```

### Command

The following XAML example shows a [`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) that uses a command to respond to the `Position` property changing:

```xaml
<CarouselView ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
              PositionChangedCommand="{Binding PositionChangedCommand}"
              PositionChangedCommandParameter="{Binding Source={RelativeSource Self}, Path=Position}">
    ...
</CarouselView>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CarouselView carouselView = new CarouselView();
carouselView.SetBinding(ItemsView.ItemsSourceProperty, "Monkeys");
carouselView.SetBinding(CarouselView.PositionChangedCommandProperty, "PositionChangedCommand");
carouselView.SetBinding(CarouselView.PositionChangedCommandParameterProperty, new Binding("Position", source: RelativeBindingSource.Self));
```

In this example, the `PositionChangedCommand` property binds to the `PositionChangedCommand` property, passing the `Position` property value to it as an argument. The `PositionChangedCommand` can then respond to the position changing, as required:

```csharp
public ICommand PositionChangedCommand => new Command<int>((position) =>
{
    PreviousPosition = CurrentPosition;
    CurrentPosition = position;
});
```

In this example, the `PositionChangedCommand` updates objects that store the previous and current positions.

## Preset the current item

The current item in a [`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) can be programmatically set by setting the `CurrentItem` property to the item. The following XAML example shows a `CarouselView` that pre-chooses the current item:

```xaml
<CarouselView ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
              CurrentItem="{Binding CurrentItem}">
    ...
</CarouselView>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CarouselView carouselView = new CarouselView();
carouselView.SetBinding(ItemsView.ItemsSourceProperty, "Monkeys");
carouselView.SetBinding(CarouselView.CurrentItemProperty, "CurrentItem");
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `CurrentItem` property has a default binding mode of `TwoWay`.

The `CarouselView.CurrentItem` property data binds to the `CurrentItem` property of the connected view model, which is of type `Monkey`. By default, a `TwoWay` binding is used so that if the user changes the current item, the value of the `CurrentItem` property will be set to the current `Monkey` object. The `CurrentItem` property is defined in the `MonkeysViewModel` class, and is set to the fourth item in the `Monkeys` collection:

```csharp
public class MonkeysViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    // ...
    public ObservableCollection<Monkey> Monkeys { get; private set; }

    public Monkey CurrentItem { get; set; }

    public MonkeysViewModel()
    {
        // ...
        CurrentItem = Monkeys.Skip(3).FirstOrDefault();
        OnPropertyChanged("CurrentItem");
    }
}
```

## Preset the position

The displayed item [`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) can be programmatically set by setting the `Position` property to the index of the item in the underlying collection. The following XAML example shows a `CarouselView` that sets the displayed item:

```xaml
<CarouselView ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
              Position="{Binding Position}">
    ...
</CarouselView>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CarouselView carouselView = new CarouselView();
carouselView.SetBinding(ItemsView.ItemsSourceProperty, "Monkeys");
carouselView.SetBinding(CarouselView.PositionProperty, "Position");
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `Position` property has a default binding mode of `TwoWay`.

The `CarouselView.Position` property data binds to the `Position` property of the connected view model, which is of type `int`. By default, a `TwoWay` binding is used so that if the user scrolls through the [`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView), the value of the `Position` property will be set to the index of the displayed item. The `Position` property is defined in the `MonkeysViewModel` class, and is set to the fourth item in the `Monkeys` collection:

```csharp
public class MonkeysViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    // ...
    public int Position { get; set; }

    public MonkeysViewModel()
    {
        // ...
        Position = 3;
        OnPropertyChanged("Position");
    }
}
```

## Clear the current item

The `CurrentItem` property can be cleared by setting it, or the object it binds to, to `null`.

## Disable bounce

By default, [`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) bounces items at content boundaries. This can be disabled by setting the `IsBounceEnabled` property to `false`.

## Disable swipe interaction

By default, [`CarouselView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView) allows users to move through items using a swipe gesture. This swipe interaction can be disabled by setting the `IsSwipeEnabled` property to `false`.

# User Interface

_How to use the views provided by Xamarin.Forms_

## [Animation](animation/index.md)

Xamarin.Forms includes its own animation infrastructure that's straightforward for creating simple animations, while also being versatile enough to create complex animations.

## [BoxView](boxview.md)

The `BoxView` is just a simple colored rectangle, but it can be used for decorative items, rudimentary graphics, and for obtaining interative touch input.

## [Colors](colors.md)

Defining and using colors across platforms can be tricky when each platform has its own standards and defaults.

## [Controls Reference](controls/index.md)

This document is a quick reference to the UI views that make up the Xamarin.Forms framework, such as [Pages](~/xamarin-forms/user-interface/controls/pages.md), [Layouts](~/xamarin-forms/user-interface/controls/layouts.md), [Views](~/xamarin-forms/user-interface/controls/views.md) and [Cells](~/xamarin-forms/user-interface/controls/cells.md).

## [DataPages](datapages/index.md)

DataPages provide an API to quickly and easily bind a data source to pre-built views. List items and detail pages will automatically render the data, and be customized using themes.

## [Graphics](graphics/index.md)

How to incorporate graphics and game engine visuals into a Xamarin.Forms application.

## [Images](images.md)

Images can be shared across platforms with Xamarin.Forms, they can be loaded specifically for each platform, or they can be downloaded for display.

## [Layouts](layouts/index.md)

Xamarin.Forms has several layouts for organizing on-screen content. `StackLayout`, `Grid`, `AbsoluteLayout`, `ScrollView`, and `RelativeLayout` can each be used to create beautiful, responsive user interfaces.

## [ListView](listview/index.md)

Xamarin.Forms provides a list view control to display scrolling rows of data. The control includes contextual actions, `HasUnevenRows` automatic sizing, separator customization, pull-to-refresh, and headers and footers.

## [Maps](map.md)

Adding maps requires an additional NuGet package download and some platform-specific configuration. Maps and pin markers can be added in just a few lines of code once the configuration is done.

## [Picker](picker/index.md)

The [`Picker`](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Xamarin.Forms.Picker/) view is a control for selecting a text item from a list of data.

## [Styles](styles/index.md)

Font, color, and other attributes can be grouped into styles which can be shared across controls, layouts, or the entire application using ResourceDictionaries.

## [TableView](tableview.md)

The table view is similar to a list view, but rather than being designed for long lists of data it is intended for data-entry-style screens of scrolling controls or simple  scrolling menus.

## [Text](text/index.md)

Xamarin.Forms has several views for presenting and receiving text. Text views can be formatted and customized for platforms. Specific font settings can enable compatibility with accessibility features.

## [Themes](themes/index.md)

Xamarin.Forms Themes define a specific visual appearance for the standard controls. Once you add a theme to the application's resource dictionary, the appearance of the standard controls will change.

## [WebView](webview.md)

Xamarin.Forms uses the native web browser control on each platform, and can display websites, local resources, and generated Html strings.

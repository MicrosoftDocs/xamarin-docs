# Theming a Xamarin.Forms Application

## [Theme an Application](theming.md)

Theming can be implemented in Xamarin.Forms applications by creating a [`ResourceDictionary`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.ResourceDictionary) for each theme, and then loading the resources with the `DynamicResource` markup extension.

## [Detect Dark Mode](dark-mode.md)

Dark mode can be supported in any Xamarin.Forms application by using a combination of [`ResourceDictionary`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.ResourceDictionary) objects, dynamic resources, and platform knowledge.

_Learn the basics of SkiaSharp graphics concepts and coordinates_

After you have added the SkiaSharp NuGet package to your Xamarin.Forms application, you can begin using SkiaSharp graphics. The [**SkiaSharpFormsDemos**](https://developer.xamarin.com/samples/xamarin-forms/SkiaSharpForms/Demos/) solution includes numerous pages that demonstrate SkiaSharp programming techniques in progressively more advanced lessons.

All the sample programs in this section appear under the heading **SkiaSharp Drawing Basics** in the home page of the [**SkiaSharpFormsDemos**](https://developer.xamarin.com/samples/xamarin-forms/SkiaSharpForms/Demos/) program, and in the [**Basics**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/SkiaSharpForms/Demos/Demos/SkiaSharpFormsDemos/Basics) folder of the solution.

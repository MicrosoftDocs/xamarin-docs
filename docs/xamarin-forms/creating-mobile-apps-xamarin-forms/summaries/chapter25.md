# Summary of Chapter 25. Page varieties

[![Download Sample](~/media/shared/download.png) Download the sample](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter25)

So far you've seen two classes that derive from `Page`: `ContentPage` and `NavigationPage`. This chapter presents two others:

- [`MasterDetailPage`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterDetailPage) manages two pages, a master and a detail
- [`TabbedPage`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TabbedPage) manages multiple child pages accessed through tabs

These page types provide more sophisticated navigation options than the
`NavagationPage` discussed in [Chapter 24. Page Navigation](~/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/summaries/chapter24.md).

## Master and Detail

The [`MasterDetailPage`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterDetailPage) defines two properties of type `Page`: [`Master`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterDetailPage.Master) and [`Detail`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterDetailPage.Detail). Generally you set each of these properties to a `ContentPage`. The `MasterDetailPage` displays and switches between these two pages.

There are two fundamental ways to switch between these two pages:

- *split* where the master and detail are side by side
- *popover* where the detail page covers or partially covers the master page

There are several variations of the *popover* approach (*slide*, *overlap*, and *swap*), but these are generally platform dependent. You can set the [`MasterDetailBehavior`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterDetailPage.MasterBehavior) property of `MasterDetailPage` to a member of the [`MasterBehavior`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterBehavior) enumeration:

- [`Default`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterBehavior.Default)
- [`Split`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterBehavior.Split)
- [`SplitOnLandscape`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterBehavior.SplitOnLandscape)
- [`SplitOnPortrait`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterBehavior.SplitOnPortrait)
- [`Popover`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterBehavior.Popover)

However, this property has no effect on phones. Phones always have a popover behavior. Only tablets and desktop windows can have a split behavior.

### Exploring the Behaviors

The [**MasterDetailBehaviors**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter25/MasterDetailBehaviors) sample allows you to experiment with the default behavior on different devices. The program contains two separate `ContentPage` derivatives for the master and detail (with a `Title` property set on both), and another class that derives from `MasterDetailPage` that combines them. The detail page is enclosed in a `NavigationPage` because the UWP program wouldn't work without it.

The Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 platforms require that a bitmap be set to the `Icon` property of the master page.

### Back to School

The
[**SchoolAndDetail**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter25/SchoolAndDetail) sample takes a somewhat different approach to constructing the program to display students from the [**SchoolOfFineArt**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/SchoolOfFineArt) library.

The `Master` and `Detail` properties are defined with visual trees in the [SchoolAndDetailPage.xaml](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Chapter25/SchoolAndDetail/SchoolAndDetail/SchoolAndDetail/SchoolAndDetailPage.xaml) file, which derives from `MasterDetailPage`. This arrangement allows data bindings to be set between the master and detail pages.

That XAML file also sets the [`IsPresented`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterDetailPage.IsPresented) property of `MasterDetailPage` to `True`. This causes the master page to be displayed at startup; by default the detail page is displayed. The [SchoolAndDetailPage.xaml.cs](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Chapter25/SchoolAndDetail/SchoolAndDetail/SchoolAndDetail/SchoolAndDetailPage.xaml.cs) file sets `IsPresented` to `false` when an item is selected from the `ListView` in the master page. The detail page is then displayed:

### Your own user interface

Although Xamarin.Forms provides a user interface for switching between the master and detail views, you can supply your own. To do so:

- Set the [`IsGestureEnabled`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterDetailPage.IsGestureEnabled) property to `false` to disable swiping
- Override the [`ShouldShowToolbarButton`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MasterDetailPage.ShouldShowToolbarButton) method and return `false` to hide the toolbar buttons on Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.

You must then provide a means to switch between the master and detail pages, such as demonstrated by the
[**ColorsDetail**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter25/ColorsDetails) sample.

The [**MasterDetailTaps**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter25/MasterDetailTaps) sample demonstrates another approach using a `TapGestureRecognizer` on the master and detail pages.

## TabbedPage

The [`TabbedPage`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TabbedPage) is a collection of pages that you can switch among using tabs. It derives from `MultiPage<Page>` and defines no public properties or methods of its own. [`MultiPage<T>`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MultiPage`1), however, does define a property:

- [`Children`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MultiPage`1.Children) property of type `IList<T>`

You fill this `Children` collection with page objects.

Another approach allows you to define the `TabbedPage` children much like a `ListView` using these two properties that generate the tabbed pages automatically:

- [`ItemsSource`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MultiPage`1.ItemsSource) of type `IEnumerable`
- [`ItemTemplate`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MultiPage`1.ItemTemplate) of type `DataTemplate`

However, this approach does not work well on iOS when the collection contains more than a few items.

`MultiPage<T>` defines two more properties that let you keep track of which page is currently viewed:

- [`CurrentPage`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MultiPage`1.CurrentPage) of type `T`, referring to the page
- [`SelectedItem`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MultiPage`1.SelectedItem) of type `Object`, referring to the object in the `ItemsSource` collection

`MultiPage<T>` also defines two events:

- [`PagesChanged`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MultiPage`1.PagesChanged) when the `ItemsSource` collection changes
- [`CurrentPageChanged`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.MultiPage`1.CurrentPageChanged) when the viewed page changes

### Discrete tab pages

The [**DiscreteTabbedColors**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter25/DiscreteTabbedColors) sample consists of three tabbed pages that display colors in three different ways. Each tab is a `ContentPage` derivative, and then the `TabbedPage` derivative [DiscreteTabbedColorsPage.xaml](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Chapter25/DiscreteTabbedColors/DiscreteTabbedColors/DiscreteTabbedColors/DiscreteTabbedColorsPage.xaml) combines the three pages.

For each page that appears in a `TabbedPage`, the `Title` property is required to specify the text in the tab, and the Apple Store requires that an icon be used as well, so the `Icon` property is set for iOS:

[![Triple screenshot of Discrete Tabbed Colors](images/ch25fg13-small.png "TabbedPage")](images/ch25fg13-large.png#lightbox "TabbedPage")

The [**StudentNotes**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter25/StudentNotes) sample has a home page that lists all the students. When a student is tapped, this navigates to a `TabbedPage` derivative, [`StudentNotesDataPage`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Chapter25/StudentNotes/StudentNotes/StudentNotes/StudentNotesDataPage.xaml), that incorporates three `ContentPage` objects in its visual tree, one of which allows entering some notes for that student.

### Using an ItemTemplate

The [**MultiTabbedColor**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter25/MultiTabbedColors) sample uses the [`NamedColor`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/NamedColor.cs) class in the [**Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit) library. The [MultiTabbedColorsPage.xaml](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Chapter25/MultiTabbedColors/MultiTabbedColors/MultiTabbedColors/MultiTabbedColorsPage.xaml) file sets the `DataTemplate` property of `TabbedPage` to a visual tree beginning with `ContentPage` that contains bindings to properties of `NamedColor` (including a binding to the `Title` property).

However, this is problematic on iOS. Only a few of the items can be displayed, and there is no good way to give them icons.

# Summary of Chapter 15. The interactive interface

[![Download Sample](~/media/shared/download.png) Download the sample](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15)

This chapter explores eight `View` derivatives that allow interaction with the user.

## View overview

Xamarin.Forms contains 20 instantiable classes that derive from `View` but not `Layout`. Six of these have been covered in previous chapters:

- `Label`: [**Chapter 2. Anatomy of an app**](chapter02.md)
- `BoxView`: [**Chapter 3. Scrolling the stack**](chapter03.md)
- `Button`: [**Chapter 6. Button clicks**](chapter06.md)
- `Image`: [**Chapter 13. Bitmaps**](chapter13.md)
- `ActivityIndicator`: [**Chapter 13. Bitmaps**](chapter13.md)
- `ProgressBar`: [**Chapter 14. AbsoluteLayout**](chapter14.md)

The eight views in this chapter effectively allow the user to interact with basic .NET data types:

|Data type|Views|
|--- |--- |
|`Double`|[`Slider`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Slider), [`Stepper`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Stepper)|
|`Boolean`|[`Switch`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Switch)|
|`String`|[`Entry`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Entry), [`Editor`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Editor), [`SearchBar`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.SearchBar)|
|`DateTime`|[`DatePicker`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.DatePicker), [`TimePicker`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TimePicker)|

You can think of these views as visual interactive representations of the underlying data types. This concept is explored more in the next chapter, [**Chapter 16. Data binding**](chapter16.md).

The remaining six views are covered in the following chapters:

- `WebView`: [**Chapter 16. Data binding**](chapter16.md)
- `Picker`: [**Chapter 19. Collection views**](chapter19.md)
- `ListView`: [**Chapter 19. Collection views**](chapter19.md)
- `TableView`: [**Chapter 19. Collection views**](chapter19.md)
- `Map`: [**Chapter 28. Location and Maps**](chapter28.md)
- `OpenGLView`: Not covered in this book (and no support for Windows platforms)

## Slider and stepper

Both [`Slider`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Slider) and [`Stepper`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Stepper) allow the user to choose a numeric value from a range. The `Slider` is a continuous range while the `Stepper` involves discrete values.

### Slider basics

The [`Slider`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Slider) is a horizontal bar representing a range of values from a minimum on the left to a maximum on the right. It defines three public properties:

- [`Value`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Slider.Value) of type `double`, default value of 0
- [`Minimum`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Slider.Minimum) of type `double`, default value of 0
- [`Maximum`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Slider.Maximum) of type `double`, default value of 1

The bindable properties that back these properties ensure that they are consistent:

- For all three properties, the [`coerceValue`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty.CoerceValueDelegate) method specified for the bindable property ensures that `Value` is between `Minimum` and `Maximum`.
- The [`validateValue`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty.ValidateValueDelegate) method on `MinimumProperty` returns `false` if `Minimum` is being set to a value greater than or equal to `Maximum`, and similar for `MaximumProperty`. Returning `false` from the `validateValue` method causes an `ArgumentException` to be raised.

`Slider` fires the [`ValueChanged`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Slider.ValueChanged) event with a [`ValueChangedEventArgs`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.ValueChangedEventArgs) argument when the `Value` property changes, either programmatically or when the user manipulates the `Slider`.

The [**SliderDemo**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/SliderDemo) sample demonstrates the simple use of the `Slider`.

### Common pitfalls

Both in code and in XAML, the `Minimum` and `Maximum` properties are set in the order that you specify. Be sure to initialize these properties so that `Maximum` is always greater than `Minimum`. Otherwise an exception will be raised.

Initializing the `Slider` properties can cause the `Value` property to change and the `ValueChanged` event to be fired. You should ensure that the `Slider` event handler doesn't access views that haven't yet been created during page initialization.

The `ValueChanged` event doesn't fire during `Slider` initialization unless the `Value` property changes. You can call the `ValueChanged` handler directly from code.

### Slider color selection

The [**RgbSliders**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/RgbSliders) program contains three `Slider` elements that allow you to interactively select a color by specifying its RGB values:

[![Triple screenshot of R G B sliders](images/ch15fg03-small.png "RGB Sliders")](images/ch15fg03-large.png#lightbox "RGB Sliders")

The [**TextFade**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/TextFade) sample uses two `Slider` elements to move two `Label` elements across an `AbsoluteLayout` and fade one into the other.

### The Stepper difference

The [`Stepper`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Stepper) defines the same properties and events as `Slider` but the `Maximum` property is initialized to 100 and `Stepper` defines a fourth property:

- [`Increment`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Stepper.Increment) of type `double`, initialized to 1

Visually, the `Stepper` consists of two buttons labeled **&ndash;** and **+**. Pressing **&ndash;** decreases `Value` by `Increment` to a minimum of `Minimum`. Pressing **+** increases `Value` by `Increment` to a maximum of `Maximum`.

This is demonstrated by the [**StepperDemo**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/StepperDemo) sample.

## Switch and CheckBox

The [`Switch`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Switch) allows the user to specify a Boolean value.

### Switch basics

Visually, the `Switch` consists of a toggle that can be turned off and on. The class defines one property:

- [`IsToggled`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Switch.IsToggled) of type `bool`

`Switch` defines one event:

- [`Toggled`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Switch.Toggled) accompanied by a [`ToggledEventArgs`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.ToggledEventArgs) object, fired when the `IsToggled` property changes.

The [**SwitchDemo**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/SwitchDemo) program demonstrates the `Switch`.

### A traditional CheckBox

Some developers might prefer a more traditional `CheckBox` to the `Switch`. The [**Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit) library contains a `CheckBox` class that derives from `ContentView`. `CheckBox` is implemented by the [CheckBox.xaml](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/CheckBox.xaml) and [CheckBox.xaml.cs](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/CheckBox.xaml.cs) files. `CheckBox` defines three properties (`Text`, `FontSize`, and `IsChecked`) and a `CheckedChanged` event.

The [**CheckBoxDemo**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/CheckBoxDemo) sample demonstrates this `CheckBox`.

## Typing text

Xamarin.Forms defines three views that let the user enter and edit text:

- [`Entry`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Entry) for a single line of text
- [`Editor`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Editor) for multiple lines of text
- [`SearchBar`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.SearchBar) for a single line of text for search purposes.

`Entry` and `Editor` derive from [`InputView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.InputView), which derives from `View`. `SearchBar` derives directly from `View`.

### Keyboard and focus

On phones and tablets without physical keyboards, the `Entry`, `Editor`, and `SearchBar` elements all cause a virtual keyboard to pop up. The presence of this keyboard on the screen is related to input focus. A view must have both its [`IsVisible`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.IsVisible) and [`IsEnabled`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.IsEnabled) properties set to `true` to get input focus.

Two methods, one read-only property, and two events are involved with input focus. These are all defined by `VisualElement`:

- The [`Focus`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.Focus) method attempts to set input focus to an element and returns `true` if successful
- The [`Unfocus`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.Unfocus) method removes input focus from an element
- The [`IsFocused`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.IsFocused) read-only property indicates if the element has input focus
- The [`Focused`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.Focused) event indicates when an element gets input focus
- The [`Unfocused`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.Unfocused) event indicates when an element loses input focus

### Choosing the Keyboard

The [`InputView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.InputView) class from which `Entry` and `Editor` derive defines only one property:

- [`Keyboard`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.InputView.Keyboard) of type [`Keyboard`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Keyboard)

This indicates the type of keyboard that is displayed. Some keyboards are optimized for URIs or numbers.

The `Keyboard` class allows defining a keyboard with a static [`Keyboard.Create`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Keyboard.Create(Xamarin.Forms.KeyboardFlags)) method with an argument of type [`KeyboardFlags`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.KeyboardFlags), an enumeration with the following bit flags:

- `None` set to 0
- [`CapitalizeSentence`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.KeyboardFlags.CapitalizeSentence) set to 1
- [`Spellcheck`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.KeyboardFlags.Spellcheck) set to 2
- [`Suggestions`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.KeyboardFlags.Suggestions) set to 4
- [`All`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.KeyboardFlags.All) set to \xFFFFFFFF

When using the multiline [`Editor`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Editor) when a paragraph or more of text is expected, calling `Keyboard.Create` is a good approach to selecting a keyboard. For the single-line [`Entry`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Entry), the following static read-only properties of `Keyboard` are useful:

- [`Default`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Keyboard.Default)
- [`Text`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Keyboard.Text)
- [`Chat`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Keyboard.Chat)
- [`Url`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Keyboard.Url)
- [`Email`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Keyboard.Email)
- [`Telephone`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Keyboard.Telephone)
- [`Numeric`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Keyboard.Numeric) for positive numbers with or without a decimal point.

The [`KeyboardTypeConverter`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.KeyboardTypeConverter) allows specifying these properties in XAML as demonstrated by the [**EntryKeyboards**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/EntryKeyboards) program.

### Entry properties and events

The single-line [`Entry`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Entry) defines the following properties:

- [`Text`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.InputView.Text) of type `string`, the text that appears in the `Entry`
- [`TextColor`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.InputView.TextColor) of type `Color`
- [`FontFamily`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Entry.FontFamily) of type `string`
- [`FontSize`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Entry.FontSize) of type `double`
- [`FontAttributes`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Entry.FontAttributes) of type `FontAttributes`
- [`IsPassword`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Entry.IsPassword) of type `bool`, which causes characters to be masked
- [`Placeholder`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.InputView.Placeholder) of type `string`, for dimly colored text that appears in the `Entry` before anything is typed
- [`PlaceholderColor`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.InputView.PlaceholderColor) of type `Color`

The `Entry` also defines two events:

- [`TextChanged`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.InputView.TextChanged) with a [`TextChangedEventArgs`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TextChangedEventArgs) object, fired whenever the `Text` property changes
- [`Completed`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Entry.Completed), fired when the user is finished and the keyboard is dismissed. The user indicates completion in a platform-specific manner

The [**QuadraticEquations**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/QuadaticEquations) sample demonstrates these two events.

### The Editor difference

The multiline [`Editor`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Editor) defines the same `Text` and `Font` properties as `Entry` but not the other properties. `Editor` also defines the same two properties as `Entry`.

[**JustNotes**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/JustNotes) is a free-form notes-taking program that saves and restores the contents of the `Editor`.

### The SearchBar

The [`SearchBar`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.SearchBar) does not derive from `InputView`, so it does not have a `Keyboard` property. But it does have all the `Text`, `Font`, and `Placeholder` properties that `Entry` defines. In addition, `SearchBar` defines three additional properties:

- [`CancelButtonColor`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.SearchBar.CancelButtonColor) of type `Color`
- [`SearchCommand`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.SearchBar.SearchCommand) of type [`ICommand`](xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand) for use with data-bindings and MVVM
- [`SearchCommandParameter`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.SearchBar.SearchCommandParameter) of type `Object`, for use with `SearchCommand`

The platform-specific cancel button erases the text. The `SearchBar` also has a platform-specific search button. Pressing either of those buttons raises one of the two events that `SearchBar` defines:

- [`TextChanged`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.InputView.TextChanged) accompanied by a [`TextChangedEventArgs`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TextChangedEventArgs) object
- [`SearchButtonPressed`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.SearchBar.SearchButtonPressed)

The [**SearchBarDemo**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/SearchBarDemo) sample demonstrates the `SearchBar`.

## Date and time selection

The [`DatePicker`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.DatePicker) and [`TimePicker`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TimePicker) views implement platform-specific controls that allow the user to specify a date or time.

### The DatePicker

[`DatePicker`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.DatePicker) defines four properties:

- [`MinimumDate`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.DatePicker.MinimumDate) of type `DateTime`, initialized to January 1, 1900
- [`MaximumDate`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.DatePicker.MaximumDate) of type `DateTime`, initialized to December 31, 2100
- [`Date`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.DatePicker.Date) of type `DateTime`, initialized to `DateTime.Today`
- [`Format`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.DatePicker.Format) of type `string`, the .NET formatting string initialized to "d", the short date pattern, resulting in a date display like "7/20/1969" in the US.

You can set the `DateTime` properties in XAML by expressing the properties as property elements and using the culture-invariant short-date format ("7/20/1969").   

The [**DaysBetweenDates**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/DaysBetweenDates) sample calculates the number of days between two dates selected by the user.

### The TimePicker (or is it a TimeSpanPicker?)

[`TimePicker`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TimePicker) defines two properties and no events:

- [`Time`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TimePicker.Time) is of type `TimeSpan` rather than `DateTime`, indicating the time elapsed since midnight
- [`Format`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TimePicker.Format) of type `string`, the .NET formatting string initialized to "t", the short time pattern, resulting in a time display like "1:45 PM" in the US.

The [**SetTimer**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter15/SetTimer) program demonstrates how to use the `TimePicker` to specify a time for a timer. The program only works if you keep it in the foreground.

**SetTimer** also demonstrates using the [`DisplayAlert`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page.DisplayAlert(System.String,System.String,System.String)) method of `Page` to display an alert box.

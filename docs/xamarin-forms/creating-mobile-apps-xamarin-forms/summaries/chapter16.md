Programmers often find themselves writing event handlers that detect when a property of one object has changed, and use that to change the value of a property in another object. This process can be automated with the technique of *data binding*. Data bindings are usually defined in XAML and become part of the definition of the user interface.

Very often, these data bindings connect user-interface objects to underlying data. This is a technique that is explored more in [**Chapter 18. MVVM**](chapter18.md). However, data bindings can also connect two or more user-interface elements. Most of the early examples of data binding in this chapter demonstrate this technique.

## Binding basics

Several properties, methods, and classes are involved in data binding:

- The [`Binding`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Binding) class derives from [`BindingBase`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindingBase) and encapsulates many characteristics of a data binding
- The [`BindingContext`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject.BindingContext) property is defined by the [`BindableObject`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject) class
- The [`SetBinding`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject.SetBinding(Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty,Xamarin.Forms.BindingBase)) method is also defined by the [`BindableObject`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject) class
- The [`BindableObjectExtensions`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableObjectExtensions) class defines three additional `SetBinding` methods

The following two classes support XAML markup extensions for bindings:

- [`BindingExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.BindingExtension) supports the `Binding` markup extension
- [`ReferenceExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.ReferenceExtension) supports the `x:Reference` markup extension

Two interfaces are involved in data binding:

- [`INotifyPropertyChanged`](xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged) in the `System.ComponentModel` namespace is for implementing notification when a property changes
- [`IValueConverter`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.IValueConverter) is used to define small classes that convert values from one type to another in data bindings

A data binding connects two properties of the same object, or (more commonly) two different objects. These two properties are referred to as the *source* and the *target*. Generally, a change in the source property causes a change to occur in the target property, but sometimes the direction is reversed. Regardless:

- the *target* property must be backed by a [`BindableProperty`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty)
- the *source* property generally is a member of a class that implements [`INotifyPropertyChanged`](xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged)

A class that implements `INotifyPropertyChanged` fires a [`PropertyChanged`](xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged) event when a property changes value. `BindableObject` implements `INotifyPropertyChanged` and automatically fires a `PropertyChanged` event when a property backed by a `BindableProperty` changes values, but you can write your own classes that implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` without deriving from `BindableObject`.

## Code and XAML

The [**OpacityBindingCode**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/OpacityBindingCode) sample demonstrates how to set a data binding in code:

- The source is the `Value` property of a `Slider`
- The target is the `Opacity` property of a `Label`

The two objects are connected by setting the `BindingContext` of the `Label` object to the `Slider` object. The two properties are connected by calling a [`SetBinding`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableObjectExtensions.SetBinding*) extension method on the `Label` referencing the `OpacityProperty` bindable property and the `Value` property of the `Slider` expressed as a string.

Manipulating the `Slider` then causes the `Label` to fade in and out of view.

The [**OpacityBindingXaml**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/OpacityBindingXaml) is the same program with the data binding set in XAML. The `BindingContext` of the `Label` is set to an `x:Reference` markup extension referencing the `Slider`, and the `Opacity` property of the `Label` is set to the `Binding` markup extension with its [`Path`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Binding.Path) property referencing the `Value` property of the `Slider`.

## Source and BindingContext

The [**BindingSourceCode**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/BindingSourceCode) sample shows an alternative approach in code. A `Binding` object is created by setting the [`Source`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Binding.Source) property to the `Slider` object and the [`Path`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Binding.Path) property to "Value". The [`SetBinding`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject.SetBinding(Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty,Xamarin.Forms.BindingBase)) method of `BindableObject` is then called on the `Label` object.

The [`Binding` constructor](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Binding.%23ctor(System.String,Xamarin.Forms.BindingMode,Xamarin.Forms.IValueConverter,System.Object,System.String,System.Object)) could also have been used to define the `Binding` object.

The [**BindingSourceXaml**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/BindingSourceXaml) sample shows the comparable technique in XAML. The `Opacity` property of the `Label` is set to a `Binding` markup extension with [`Path`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Binding.Path) set to the `Value` property and [`Source`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Binding.Source) set to an embedded `x:Reference` markup extension.

In summary, there are two ways to reference the binding source object:

- Through the `BindingContext` property of the target
- Through the `Source` property of the `Binding` object itself

If both are specified, the second takes precedence. The advantage of the `BindingContext` is that it is propagated through the visual tree. This is *very* handy if multiple target properties are bound to the same source object.

The [**WebViewDemo**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/WebViewDemo) program demonstrates this technique with the [`WebView`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.WebView) element. Two `Button` elements for navigating backwards and forwards inherit a `BindingContext` from their parent that references the `WebView`. The `IsEnabled` properties of the two buttons then have simple `Binding` markup extensions that target the button `IsEnabled` properties based on the settings of the [`CanGoBack`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.WebView.CanGoBack) and [`CanGoForward`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.WebView.CanGoForward) read-only properties of the `WebView`.

## The binding mode

Set the [`Mode`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindingBase.Mode) property of `Binding` to a member of the [`BindingMode`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindingMode) enumeration:

- [`OneWay`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindingMode.OneWay) so that changes in the source property affect the target
- [`OneWayToSource`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindingMode.OneWayToSource) so that changes in the target property affect the source
- [`TwoWay`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindingMode.TwoWay) so that changes in the source and target affect each other
- [`Default`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindingMode.Default) to use the [`DefaultBindingMode`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty.DefaultBindingMode) specified when the target `BindableProperty` was created. If none was specified, the default is `OneWay` for normal bindable properties, and `OneWayToSource` for read-only bindable properties.

> [!NOTE]
> The `BindingMode` enumeration now also includes `OnTime` for applying a binding only when the binding context changes and not when the source property changes.

Properties that are likely to be the targets of data bindings in MVVM scenarios generally have a `DefaultBindingMode` of `TwoWay`. These are:

- `Value` property of `Slider` and `Stepper`
- `IsToggled` property of `Switch`
- `Text` property of `Entry`, `Editor`, and `SearchBar`
- `Date` property of `DatePicker`
- `Time` property of `TimePicker`

The [**BindingModes**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/BindingModes) sample demonstrates the four binding modes with a data binding where the target is the `FontSize` property of a `Label` and the source is the `Value` property of a `Slider`. This allows each `Slider` to control the font size of the corresponding `Label`. But the `Slider` elements are not initialized because the `DefaultBindingMode` of the `FontSize` property is `OneWay`.

The [**ReverseBinding**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/ReverseBinding) sample sets the bindings on the `Value` property of the `Slider` referencing the `FontSize` property of each `Label`. This appears to be backwards, but it works better in initialzing the `Slider` elements because the `Value` property of the `Slider` has a `DefaultBindingMode` of `TwoWay`.

This is analogous to how bindings are defined in MVVM, and you'll use this type of binding frequently.

## String formatting

When the target property is of type `string`, you can use the [`StringFormat`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindingBase.StringFormat) property defined by `BindingBase` to convert the source to a `string`. Set the `StringFormat` property to a .NET formatting string that you would use with the static [`String.Format`](xref:System.String.Format(System.String,System.Object)) format to display the object. When using this formatting string within a markup extension, surround it with single quotation marks so the curly braces won't be mistaken for an embedded markup extension.

The [**ShowViewValues**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/ShowViewValues) sample demonstrates how to use `StringFormat` in XAML.

The [**WhatSizeBindings**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/WhatSizeBindings) sample demonstrates displaying the size of the page with bindings to the `Width` and `Height` properties of the `ContentPage`.

## Why is it called "Path"?

The [`Path`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Binding.Path) property of `Binding` is so called because it can be a series of properties and indexers separated by periods. The [**BindingPathDemos**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/BindingPathDemos) sample shows several examples.

## Binding value converters

When the source and target properties of a binding are different types, you can convert between the types using a binding converter. This is a class that implements the [`IValueConverter`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.IValueConverter) interface and contains two methods: [`Convert`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.IValueConverter.Convert(System.Object,System.Type,System.Object,System.Globalization.CultureInfo)) to convert the source to the target, and [`ConvertBack`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.IValueConverter.ConvertBack(System.Object,System.Type,System.Object,System.Globalization.CultureInfo)) to convert the target to the source.

The [`IntToBoolConverter`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/IntToBoolConverter.cs) class in the [**Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit) library is an example for converting an `int` to a `bool`. It is demonstrated by the [**ButtonEnabler**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/ButtonEnabler) sample, which only enables the `Button` if at least one character has been typed into an `Entry`.

The [`BoolToStringConverter`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/BoolToStringConverter.cs) class converts a `bool` to a `string` and defines two properties to specify what text should be returned for `false` and `true` values.
The [`BoolToColorConverter`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/BoolToColorConverter.cs) is similar. The [**SwitchText**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/SwitchText) sample demonstrates using these two converters to display different texts in different colors based on a `Switch` setting.

The generic [`BoolToObjectConverter`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/BoolToObjectConverter.cs) can replace the `BoolToStringConverter` and `BoolToColorConverter` and serve as a generalized `bool`-to-object converter of any type.

## Bindings and custom views

You can simplify custom controls using data bindings. The [`NewCheckBox.cs`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/NewCheckBox.xaml.cs) code file defines `Text`, `TextColor`, `FontSize`, `FontAttributes`, and `IsChecked` properties, but has no logic at all for the visuals of the control.
Instead the [`NewCheckBox.cs.xaml`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/NewCheckBox.xaml) file contains all the markup for the control's visuals through data bindings on the `Label` elements based on the properties defined in the code-behind file.

The [**NewCheckBoxDemo**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter16/NewCheckBoxDemo) sample demonstrates the `NewCheckBox` custom control.

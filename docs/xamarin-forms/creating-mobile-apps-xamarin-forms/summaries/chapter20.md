# Summary of Chapter 20. Async and file I/O

[![Download Sample](~/media/shared/download.png) Download the sample](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20)

> [!NOTE] 
> Notes on this page indicate areas where Xamarin.Forms has diverged from the material presented in the book.

 A graphical user interface must respond to user-input events sequentially. This implies that all processing of user-input events must occur in a single thread, often called the *main thread* or the *UI thread*.

Users expect graphical user interfaces to be responsive. This means that a program must process user-input events quickly. If that is not possible, then processing must be relegated to secondary threads of execution.

Several sample programs in this book have used the [`WebRequest`](xref:System.Net.WebRequest) class. In this class the [`BeginGetResponse`](xref:System.Net.WebRequest.BeginGetResponse(System.AsyncCallback,System.Object)) method starts a worker thread, which calls a callback function when it is complete. However, that callback function runs in the worker thread, so the program must call [`Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread(System.Action)) method to access the user interface.

> [!NOTE]
> Xamarin.Forms programs should use [`HttpClient`](xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient) rather than [`WebRequest`](xref:System.Net.WebRequest) for accessing files over the internet. `HttpClient` supports asynchronous operations.

A more modern approach to asynchronous processing is available in .NET and C#. This involves the [`Task`](xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task) and [`Task<TResult>`](xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task`1) classes, and other types in the [`System.Threading`](xref:System.Threading) and [`System.Threading.Tasks`](xref:System.Threading.Tasks) namespaces, as well as the C# 5.0 `async` and `await` keywords. That's what this chapter focuses on.

## From callbacks to await

The `Page` class itself contains three asynchronous methods to display alert boxes:

- [`DisplayAlert`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page.DisplayAlert(System.String,System.String,System.String)) returns a `Task` object
- [`DisplayAlert`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page.DisplayAlert(System.String,System.String,System.String,System.String)) returns a `Task<bool>` object
- [`DisplayActionSheet`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page.DisplayActionSheet(System.String,System.String,System.String,System.String[])) returns a `Task<string>` object

The `Task` objects indicate that these methods implement the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern, known as TAP. These `Task` objects are returned quickly from the method. The `Task<T>` return values constitute a "promise" that a value of type `TResult` will be available when the task completes. The `Task` return value indicates an asynchronous action that will complete but with no value returned.

In all these cases, the `Task` is complete when the user dismisses the alert box.  

### An alert with callbacks

The [**AlertCallbacks**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/AlertCallbacks) sample demonstrates how to handle `Task<bool>` return objects and `Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread` calls using callback methods.

### An alert with lambdas

The [**AlertLambdas**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/AlertLambdas)
sample demonstrates how to use anonymous lambda functions for handling `Task` and `Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread` calls.  

### An alert with await

A more straightforward approach involves the `async` and `await` keywords introduced in C# 5. The  [**AlertAwait**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/AlertAwait)
sample demonstrates their use.

### An alert with nothing

If the asynchronous method returns `Task` rather than `Task<TResult>`, then the program doesn't need to use any of these techniques if it doesn't need to know when the asynchronous task completes. The
[**NothingAlert**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/NothingAlert)
sample demonstrates this.

### Saving program settings asynchronously

The [**SaveProgramChanges**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/SaveProgramSettings) sample demonstrates the use of the [`SavePropertiesAsync`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Application.SavePropertiesAsync) method of `Application` to save program settings as they change without overriding the `OnSleep` method.

### A platform-independent timer

It's possible to use [`Task.Delay`](xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Delay(System.Int32)) to create a platform-independent timer. The
[**TaskDelayClock**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/TaskDelayClock) sample demonstrates this.

## File input/output

Traditionally, the .NET [`System.IO`](xref:System.IO) namespace has been the source of file I/O support. Although some methods in this namespace support asynchronous operations, most do not. The namespace also supports several simple method calls that perform sophisticated file I/O functions.

### Good news and bad news

All the platforms supported by Xamarin.Forms support application local storage &mdash; storage that is private to the application.

The Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android libraries include a version of .NET that Xamarin has expressly tailored for these two platforms. These include classes from `System.IO` that you can use to perform file I/O with application local storage in these two platforms.

However, if you search for these `System.IO` classes in a Xamarin.Forms PCL, you won't find them. The problem is that Microsoft completely revamped file I/O for the Windows Runtime API. Programs targeting Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1, and the Universal Windows Platform do not use `System.IO` for file I/O.

This means that you'll need to use the [`DependencyService`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.DependencyService) (first discussed in [**Chapter 9. Platform-specific API calls**](chapter09.md) to implement file I/O.

> [!NOTE]
> Portable Class Libaries have been replaced with .NET Standard 2.0 libraries, and .NET Standard 2.0 supports [`System.IO`](xref:System.IO) types for all Xamarin.Forms platforms. It is no longer necessary to use a `DependencyService` for most file I/O tasks. See [File Handling in Xamarin.Forms](~/xamarin-forms/data-cloud/data/files.md) for a more modern approach to file I/O.

### A first shot at cross-platform file I/O

The
[**TextFileTryout**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/TextFileTryout) sample defines an [`IFileHelper`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Chapter20/TextFileTryout/TextFileTryout/TextFileTryout/IFileHelper.cs) interface for file I/O, and implementations of this interface in all the platforms. However, the Windows Runtime implementations don't work with the methods in this interface because the Windows Runtime file I/O methods are asynchronous.

### Accommodating Windows Runtime file I/O

Programs running under the Windows Runtime use classes in the [`Windows.Storage`](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage) and [`Windows.Storage.Streams`](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Streams) namespaces for file I/O, including application local storage. Because Microsoft determined that any operation requiring more than 50 milliseconds should be asynchronous to avoid blocking the UI thread, these file I/O methods are mostly asynchronous.

The code demonstrating this new approach will be in a library so that it can be used by other applications.

## Platform-specific libraries

It's advantageous to store reusable code in libraries. This is obviously more difficult when different pieces of the reusable code are for entirely different operating systems.

The [**Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform) solution demonstrates one approach. This solution contains seven different projects:

- [**Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform), a normal Xamarin.Forms PCL
- [**Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.iOS**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.iOS), an iOS class library
- [**Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.Android**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.Android), an Android class library
- [**Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.UWP**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.UWP), a Universal Windows class library
- [**Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.WinRT**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.WinRT), a shared project for code that is common to all the Windows platforms

All the individual platform projects (with the exception of **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.WinRT**) have references to **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform**. The three Windows projects have a reference to **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.WinRT**.

All the projects contain a static `Toolkit.Init` method to ensure that the library is loaded if it's not directly referenced by a project in a Xamarin.Forms application solution.

The **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform** project contains the new [`IFileHelper`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/IFileHelper.cs) interface. All the methods now have names with `Async` suffixes and return `Task` objects.

The **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.WinRT** project contains the [`FileHelper`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.WinRT/FileHelper.cs) class for the Windows Runtime.

The **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.iOS** project contains the [`FileHelper`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.iOS/FileHelper.cs) class for iOS. These methods must now be asynchronous. Some of the methods use the asynchronous versions of methods defined in `StreamWriter` and `StreamReader`: [`WriteAsync`](xref:System.IO.StreamWriter.WriteAsync(System.String)) and [`ReadToEndAsync`](xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadToEndAsync). Others convert a result to a `Task` object using the [`FromResult`](xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.FromResult*) method.

The **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.Android** project contains a similar [`FileHelper`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.Android/FileHelper.cs) class for Android.

The **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform** project also contains a [`FileHelper`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/FileHelper.cs) class that eases the use of the `DependencyService` object.

To use these libraries, an application solution must include all the projects in the **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform** solution, and each of the application projects must have a reference to the corresponding library in **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform**.

The [**TextFileAsync**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/TextFileAsync) solution demonstrates how to use the **Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform** libraries. Each of the projects has a call to `Toolkit.Init`. The application makes use of the asynchronous file I/O functions.

### Keeping it in the background

Methods in libraries that make calls to multiple asynchronous methods &mdash; such as the `WriteFileAsync` and `ReadFileASync` methods in the Windows Runtime [`FileHelper`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform/Xamarin.FormsBook.Platform.WinRT/FileHelper.cs) class &mdash; can be made somewhat more efficient by using the [`ConfigureAwait`](xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task`1.ConfigureAwait(System.Boolean)) method to avoid switching back to the user-interface thread.

### Don't block the UI thread!

Sometimes it's tempting to avoid the use of `ContinueWith` or `await` by using the [`Result`](xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task`1.Result) property on the methods. This should be avoided for it can block the UI thread or even hang the application.

## Your own awaitable methods

You can run some code asynchronously by passing it to one of the [`Task.Run`](xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Run(System.Action)) methods. You can call `Task.Run` within an async method that handles some of the overhead.

The various `Task.Run` patterns are discussed below.

### The basic Mandelbrot set

To draw the Mandelbrot set in real time, the [**Xamarin.Forms.Toolkit**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit) library has a [`Complex`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Complex.cs) structure similar to the one in the `System.Numerics` namespace.

The [**MandelbrotSet**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/MandelbrotSet) sample has a `CalculateMandeblotAsync` method in its code-behind file that calculates the basic black-and-white Mandelbrot set and uses [`BmpMaker`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/BmpMaker.cs) to put it on a bitmap.

### Marking progress

To report progress from an asynchronous method, you can instantiate a [`Progress<T>`](xref:System.Progress`1) class and define your asynchronous method to have an argument of type [`IProgress<T>`](xref:System.IProgress`1). This is demonstrated in the [**MandelbrotProgress**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/MandelbrotProgress) sample.

### Cancelling the job

You can also write an asynchronous method to be cancellable. You begin with a class named [`CancellationTokenSource`](xref:System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource). The [`Token`](xref:System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource.Token) property is a value of type [`CancellationToken`](xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken). This is passed to the asynchronous function. A program calls the [`Cancel`](xref:System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource.Cancel) method of `CancellationTokenSource` (generally in response to an action by the user) to cancel the asynchronous function.

The asynchronous method can periodically check the [`IsCancellationRequested`](xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested) property of `CancellationToken` and exit if the property is `true`, or simply call the [`ThrowIfCancellationRequested`](xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested) method, in which case the method ends with an [`OperationCancelledException`](xref:System.OperationCanceledException).

The [**MandelbrotCancellation**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/MandelbrotCancellation) sample demonstrates the use of a cancellable function.

### An MVVM Mandelbrot

The
[**MandelbrotXF**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/MandelbrotXF) sample has a more extensive user interface, and it's mostly based on a [`MandelbrotModel`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Chapter20/MandelbrotXF/MandelbrotXF/MandelbrotXF/MandelbrotModel.cs) and [`MandelbrotViewModel`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Chapter20/MandelbrotXF/MandelbrotXF/MandelbrotXF/MandelbrotViewModel.cs) classes:

## Back to the web

The [`WebRequest`](xref:System.Net.WebRequest) class used in some samples uses an old-fashioned asynchronous protocol called the Asynchronous Programming Model or APM. You can convert such a class to the modern TAP protocol using one of the `FromAsync` methods in the [`TaskFactory`](xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskFactory`1) class. The
[**ApmToTap**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter20/ApmToTap)
sample demonstrates this.

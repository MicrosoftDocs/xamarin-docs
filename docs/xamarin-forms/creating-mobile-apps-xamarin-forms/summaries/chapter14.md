# Summary of Chapter 14. Absolute layout

[![Download Sample](~/media/shared/download.png) Download the sample](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14)

Like `StackLayout`, [`AbsoluteLayout`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayout) derives from `Layout<View>` and inherits a `Children` property. `AbsoluteLayout` implements a layout system that requires the programmer to specify the positions of its children and, optionally, their size. The position is specified by the upper-left corner of the child relative to the upper-left corner of the `AbsoluteLayout` in device-independent units. `AbsoluteLayout` also implements a proportional positioning and sizing feature.

`AbsoluteLayout` should be regarded as a special-purpose layout system to be used only when the programmer can impose a size on the children (for example, `BoxView` elements) or when the element's size doesn't affect the positioning of other children. The `HorizontalOptions` and `VerticalOptions` properties have no effect on children of an `AbsoluteLayout`.

This chapter also introduces the important feature of *attached bindable properties* that allow properties defined in one class (in this case `AbsoluteLayout`) to be attached to another class (a child of the `AbsoluteLayout`).

## AbsoluteLayout in code

You can add a child to the `Children` collection of an `AbsoluteLayout` using the standard [`Add`](xref:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection`1.Add*) method, but `AbsoluteLayout` also provides an extended [`Add`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayout.IAbsoluteList`1.Add*) method that lets you specify a [`Rectangle`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Rectangle). Another [`Add`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayout.IAbsoluteList`1.Add*) method requires only a [`Point`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Point), in which case the child is unconstrained and sizes itself.

You can create a `Rectangle` value with a [constructor](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Rectangle.%23ctor(System.Double,System.Double,System.Double,System.Double)) that requires four values &mdash; the first two indicating the position of the upper-left corner of the child relative to its parent, and the second two indicating the child's size. Or you can use a [constructor](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Rectangle.%23ctor(Xamarin.Forms.Point,Xamarin.Forms.Size)) that requires a `Point` and a [`Size`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Size) value.

These `Add` methods are demonstrated in [**AbsoluteDemo**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14/AbsoluteDemo), which positions `BoxView` elements using `Rectangle` values, and a `Label` element using just a `Point` value.

The [**ChessboardFixed**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14/ChessboardFixed) sample uses 32 `BoxView` elements to create the chessboard pattern. The program gives the `BoxView` elements a hard-coded size of 35 units square. The `AbsoluteLayout` has its `HorizontalOptions` and `VerticalOptions` set to `LayoutOptions.Center`, which causes the `AbsoluteLayout` to have a total size of 280 units square.

## Attached bindable properties

It is also possible to set the position and, optionally, the size of a child of an `AbsoluteLayout` after it has been added to the `Children` collection using the static method [`AbsoluteLayout.SetLayoutBounds`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayout.SetLayoutBounds(Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject,Xamarin.Forms.Rectangle)). The first argument is the child; the second is a `Rectangle` object. You can specify that the child sizes itself horizontally and/or vertically by setting width and height values to the  [`AbsoluteLayout.AutoSize`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayout.AutoSize) constant.

The [**ChessboardDynamic**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14/ChessboardDynamic) sample puts the `AbsoluteLayout` in a `ContentView` with a `SizeChanged` handler to call `AbsoluteLayout.SetLayoutBounds` on all the children to make them as large as possible.  

The attached bindable property that `AbsoluteLayout` defines is the static read-only field of type `BindableProperty` named [`AbsoluteLayout.LayoutBoundsProperty`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayout.LayoutBoundsProperty). The static `AbsoluteLayout.SetLayoutBounds` method is implemented by calling `SetValue` on the child with the `AbsoluteLayout.LayoutBoundsProperty`. The child contains a dictionary in which the attached bindable property and its value are stored. During layout, the `AbsoluteLayout` can obtain that value by calling [`AbsoluteLayout.GetLayoutBounds`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayout.GetLayoutBounds(Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject)), which is implemented with a `GetValue` call.

## Proportional sizing and positioning

`AbsoluteLayout` implements a proportional sizing and positioning feature. The class defines a second attached bindable property, [`LayoutFlagsProperty`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayout.LayoutFlagsProperty), with the related static methods [`AbsoluteLayout.SetLayoutFlags`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayout.SetLayoutFlags(Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject,Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayoutFlags)) and [`AbsoluteLayout.GetLayoutFlags`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayout.GetLayoutFlags(Xamarin.Forms.BindableObject)).

The argument to `AbsoluteLayout.SetLayoutFlags` and the return value of `AbsoluteLayout.GetLayoutFlags` is a value of type [`AbsoluteLayoutFlags`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayoutFlags), an enumeration with the following members:

- [`None`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayoutFlags.None) (equal to 0)
- [`XProportional`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayoutFlags.XProportional) (1)
- [`YProportional`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayoutFlags.YProportional) (2)
- [`PositionProportional`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayoutFlags.PositionProportional) (3)
- [`WidthProportional`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayoutFlags.WidthProportional) (4)
- [`HeightProportional`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayoutFlags.HeightProportional) (8)
- [`SizeProportional`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayoutFlags.SizeProportional) (12)
- [`All`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.AbsoluteLayoutFlags.All) (\xFFFFFFFF)

You can combine these with the C# bitwise OR operator.

With these flags set, certain properties of the `Rectangle` layout bounds structure used to position and size the child are interpreted proportionally.

When the `WidthProportional` flag is set, a `Width` value of 1 means that the child is the same width as the `AbsoluteLayout`. A similar approach is used for the height.

The proportional positioning takes the size into account. When the `XProportional` flag is set, the `X` property of the `Rectangle` layout bounds is proportional. A value of 0 means that the child's left edge is positioned at the left edge of the `AbsoluteLayout`, but a position of 1 means that the child's right edge is positioned at the right edge of the `AbsoluteLayout`, not beyond the right edge of the `AbsoluteLayout` as you might expect. An `X` property of 0.5 centers the child horizontally in the `AbsoluteLayout`.

The [**ChessboardProportional**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14/ChessboardProportional) sample demonstrates the use of proportional sizing and positioning.

## Working with proportional coordinates

Sometimes, it's easier to think of proportional positioning differently than how it's implemented in the `AbsoluteLayout`. You might prefer to work with proportional coordinates where an `X` property of 1 positions the child's left edge (rather than the right edge) against the right edge of the `AbsoluteLayout`.

This alternative positioning scheme can be called "fractional child coordinates." You can convert from fractional child coordinates to the layout bounds required for `AbsoluteLayout` using the following formulas:

layoutBounds.X = (fractionalChildCoordinate.X / (1 - layoutBounds.Width))

layoutBounds.Y = (fractionalChildCoordinate.Y / (1 - layoutBounds.Height))

The [**ProportionalCoordinateCalc**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14/PropCoordCalc) sample demonstrates this.

## AbsoluteLayout and XAML

You can use an `AbsoluteLayout` in XAML and set the attached bindable properties on the children of an `AbsoluteLayout` using attribute values of `AbsoluteLayout.LayoutBounds` and `AbsoluteLayout.LayoutFlags`. This is demonstrated in the [**AbsoluteXamlDemo**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14/AbsoluteXamlDemo) and the [**ChessboardXaml**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14/ChessboardXaml) samples. The latter program contains 32 `BoxView` elements but uses an implicit `Style` that includes the `AbsoluteLayout.LayoutFlags` property to keep the markup down to a minimum.

An attribute in XAML that consists of a class name, a dot, and a property name is *always* an attached bindable property.

## Overlays

You can use `AbsoluteLayout` to construct an *overlay*, which covers the page with other controls, perhaps to protect the user from interacting with the normal controls on the page.

The [**SimpleOverlay**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14/SimpleOverlay) sample demonstrates this technique, and also demonstrates the [`ProgressBar`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.ProgressBar), which displays the extent to which a program has completed a task.

## Some fun

The [**DotMatrixClock**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14/DotMatrixClock) sample displays the current time with a simulated 5x7 dot matrix display. Each dot is a `BoxView` (there are 228 of them) sized and positioned on the `AbsoluteLayout`.

The [**BouncingText**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter14/BouncingText) program animates two `Label` objects to bounce horizontally and vertically across the screen.

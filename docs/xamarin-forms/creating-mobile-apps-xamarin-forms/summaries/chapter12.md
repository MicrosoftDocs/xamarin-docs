# Summary of Chapter 12. Styles

[![Download Sample](~/media/shared/download.png) Download the sample](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter12)

In Xamarin.Forms, styles allow multiple views to share a collection of property settings. This reduces markup and enables maintaining consistent visual themes.

Styles are almost always defined and consumed in markup. An object of type [`Style`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Style) is instantiated in a resource dictionary and then set to the [`Style`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.NavigableElement.Style) property of a visual element using a `StaticResource` or `DynamicResource` markup extension.

## The basic Style

A `Style` requires that its  [`TargetType`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Style.TargetType) be set to the type of the visual object it applies to. When a `Style` is instantiated in a resource dictionary (as is common) it also requires an `x:Key` attribute.

The `Style` has a content property of type [`Setters`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Style.Setters), which is a collection of [`Setter`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Setter) objects. Each `Setter` associates a [`Property`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Setter.Property) with a [`Value`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Setter.Value).

In XAML the `Property` setting is the name of a CLR property (such as the `Text` property of `Button`) but the styled property must be backed by a bindable property. Also, the property must be defined in the class indicated by the `TargetType` setting, or inherited by that class.

You can specify the `Value` setting using the property element `<Setter.Value>`. This lets you set `Value` to an object that can't be expressed in a text string, or to an `OnPlatform` object, or to an object instantiated using `x:Arguments` or `x:FactoryMethod`. The `Value` property can also be set with a `StaticResource` expression to another item in the dictionary.

The [**BasicStyle**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter12/BasicStyle) program demonstrates the basic syntax and shows how to reference the `Style` with a `StaticResource` markup extension:

The `Style` object and any object created in the `Style` object as a `Value` setting are shared among all views referencing that `Style`. The `Style` cannot contain anything that cannot be shared, such as a `View` derivative.

Event handlers cannot be set in a `Style`. The `GestureRecognizers` property cannot be set in a `Style` because it is not backed by a bindable property.

## Styles in code

Although it's not common, you can instantiate and initialize `Style` objects in code. This is demonstrated by the [**BasicStyleCode**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter12/BasicStyleCode) sample.

## Style inheritance

`Style` has a [`BasedOn`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Style.BasedOn) property that you can set to a `StaticResource` markup extension referencing another style. This allows styles to inherit from previous styles, and add or replace property settings. The [**StyleInheritance**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter12/StyleInheritance) sample demonstrates this.

If `Style2` is based on `Style1`, the `TargetType` of `Style2` must be the same as `Style1` or derived from `Style1`. The resource dictionary in which `Style1` is stored must be the same resource dictionary as `Style2` or a resource dictionary higher in the visual tree.

## Implicit styles

If a `Style` in a resource dictionary does not have an `x:Key` attribute setting, it is assigned a dictionary key automatically, and the `Style` object becomes an *implicit style*. A view without a `Style` setting and whose type matches the `TargetType` exactly will find that style, as the [**ImplicitStyle**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter12/ImplicitStyle) sample demonstrates.

An implicit style can derive from a `Style` with an `x:Key` setting but not the other way around. You cannot explicitly reference an implicit style.

You can implement three types of hierarchy with styles and `BasedOn`:

- From styles defined on the `Application` and `Page` down to styles defined on layouts lower in the visual tree.
- From styles defined for base classes such as `VisualElement` and `View` to styles defined for specific classes.
- From styles with explicit dictionary keys to implicit styles.

These hierarchies are demonstrated in the [**StyleHierarchy**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter12/StyleHierarchy) sample.

## Dynamic styles

A style in a resource dictionary can be referenced by `DynamicResource` rather than `StaticResource`. This makes the style a *dynamic style*. If that style is replaced in the resource dictionary by another style with the same key, the views referencing that style with `DynamicResource` automatically change. Also, the absence of a dictionary entry with the specified key will cause `StaticResource` to raise an exception but not `DynamicResource`.

You can use this technique to dynamically change styling or themes as the
[**DynamicStyles**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter12/DynamicStyles) sample demonstrates.

However, you cannot set the `BasedOn` property to a `DynamicResource` makeup extension because `BasedOn` isn't backed by a bindable property. To derive a style dynamically, do not set `BasedOn`. Instead, set the [`BaseResourceKey`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Style.BaseResourceKey) property to the dictionary key of the style you want to derive from. The [**DynamicStylesInheritance**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter12/DynaStylesInh) sample demonstrates this technique.

## Device styles

The [`Device.Styles`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles) nested class defines twelve static read-only fields for six styles with a `TargetType` of `Label` that you can use for common types of text usages.

Six of these fields are of type `Style` that you can set directly to a `Style` property in code:

- [`BodyStyle`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.BodyStyle)
- [`TitleStyle`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.TitleStyle)
- [`SubtitleStyle`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.SubtitleStyle)
- [`CaptionStyle`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.CaptionStyle)
- [`ListItemTextStyle`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.ListItemTextStyle)
- [`ListItemDetailTextStyle`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.ListItemDetailTextStyle)

The other six fields are of type `string` and can be used as dictionary keys for dynamic styles:

- [`BodyStyleKey`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.BodyStyleKey) equal to "BodyStyle"
- [`TitleStyleKey`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.TitleStyleKey) equal to "TitleStyle"
- [`SubtitleStyleKey`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.SubtitleStyleKey) equal to "SubtitleStyle"
- [`CaptionStyleKey`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.CaptionStyleKey) equal to "CaptionStyle"
- [`ListItemTextStyleKey`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.ListItemTextStyleKey) equal to "ListItemTextStyle"
- [`ListItemDetailTextStyleKey`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Device.Styles.ListItemDetailTextStyleKey) equal to "ListItemDetailTextStyle"

These styles are illustrated by the [**DeviceStylesList**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter12/DeviceStylesList) sample.

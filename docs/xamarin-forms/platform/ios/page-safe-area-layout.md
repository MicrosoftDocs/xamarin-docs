# Safe Area Layout Guide on iOS

[![Download Sample](~/media/shared/download.png) Download the sample](https://developer.xamarin.com/samples/xamarin-forms/UserInterface/PlatformSpecifics/)

This iOS platform-specific is used to ensure that page content is positioned on an area of the screen that is safe for all devices that use iOS 11 and greater. Specifically, it will help to make sure that content isn't clipped by rounded device corners, the home indicator, or the sensor housing on an iPhone X. It's consumed in XAML by setting the `Page.UseSafeArea` attached property to a `boolean` value:

```xaml
<ContentPage ...
             xmlns:ios="clr-namespace:Xamarin.Forms.PlatformConfiguration.iOSSpecific;assembly=Xamarin.Forms.Core"
             Title="Safe Area"
             ios:Page.UseSafeArea="true">
    <StackLayout>
        ...
    </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```

Alternatively, it can be consumed from C# using the fluent API:

```csharp
using Xamarin.Forms.PlatformConfiguration;
using Xamarin.Forms.PlatformConfiguration.iOSSpecific;
...

On<iOS>().SetUseSafeArea(true);
```

The `Page.On<iOS>` method specifies that this platform-specific will only run on iOS. The `Page.SetUseSafeArea` method, in the [`Xamarin.Forms.PlatformConfiguration.iOSSpecific`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.PlatformConfiguration.iOSSpecific) namespace, controls whether the safe area layout guide is enabled.

The result is that page content can be positioned on an area of the screen that is safe for all iPhones:

> [!NOTE]
> The safe area defined by Apple is used in Xamarin.Forms to set the [`Page.Padding`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page.Padding) property, and will override any previous values of this property that have been set.

The safe area can be customized by retrieving its [`Thickness`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Thickness) value with the `Page.SafeAreaInsets` method from the [`Xamarin.Forms.PlatformConfiguration.iOSSpecific`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.PlatformConfiguration.iOSSpecific) namespace. It can then be modified as required and re-assigned to the `Padding` property in the page constructor or [`OnAppearing`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page.OnAppearing) override:

```csharp
protected override void OnAppearing()
{
    base.OnAppearing();

    var safeInsets = On<iOS>().SafeAreaInsets();
    safeInsets.Left = 20;
    Padding = safeInsets;
}
```

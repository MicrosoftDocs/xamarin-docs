# Setup Sign In with Apple for Xamarin.Forms

This guide covers the series of steps needed to setup your cross-platform applications to take advanced of Sign In with Apple. While the Apple setup is straight forward in the Apple Developer Portal, additional steps are necessary to create a secure relationship between your Android and Apple.

## Apple developer setup

Before you can use Sign In with Apple in your applications, you'll need to address some setup steps in the [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/) section of Apple's Developer Portal.

### Apple sign in domain

Register your domain name and verify it with Apple in the [More](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/services/list) section of the *Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles* section.

Add your domain and click **Register**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you see an error about your domain not being SPF Compliant, you will need to add a SPF DNS TXT Record to your domain and wait for it to propagate before continuing:
> The SPF TXT may look something like this:
> `v=spf1 a a:myapp.com -all`

Next you will need to verify ownership of the domain by clicking **Download** to retrieve the `apple-developer-domain-association.txt` file, and upload it to the `.well-known` folder of your domain's website.

Once the `.well-known/apple-developer-domain-association.txt` file is uploaded, and reachable, you can click **Verify** to have Apple verify your domain ownership.

> [!NOTE]
> Apple will verify ownership with `https://`. Ensure you have SSL setup and the file is accessible through a secure URL.

Successfully complete this process before continuing.

## Setup your App ID

In the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) section, create a new identifier, and choose **App IDs**. If you already have an App ID, choose to edit it instead.

![Create a new App ID](sign-in-images/readme-appid-create.png)

Enable **Sign In with Apple**. You will most likely want to use the **Enable as primary App ID** option.

![Enable Sign In with Apple](sign-in-images/readme-appid-signin.png)

Save your App ID changes.

## Create a Service ID

In the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId) section, create a new identifier, and choose **Service IDs**.

![Create a new Service ID](sign-in-images/readme-serviceid-create.png)

Give your Services ID a description, and an identifier.  This identifier will be your `ServerId`.  Make sure to enable **Sign In with Apple**.

Before continuing, click **Configure** next to the _Sign In with Apple_ option you enabled.

In the configuration panel, ensure the correct **Primary App ID** is selected.

Next, choose the **Web Domain** you configured previously.

Finally, add one or more **Return URLs**.  Any `redirect_uri` you use later must be registered here exactly as you use it.  Make sure you include the `http://` or `https://` in the URL when you enter it.

> [!NOTE]
> For testing purposes, you cannot use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, but you can use other domains such as `local.test`.  If you choose to do this, you can edit your machine's `hosts` file to resolve this fictitious domain to your local IP address.

![Configure your Apple Sign In](sign-in-images/readme-serviceid-configure.png)

Save your changes when finished.

## Create a key for your Services ID

In the [Keys](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list) section, create a new **Key**.

Give your key a name, and enable **Sign In with Apple**.

![Create a new Key](sign-in-images/readme-key-create.png)

Click **Configure** beside _Sign In with Apple_.

Ensure the correct **Primary App ID** is selected and click **Save**.

Click **Continue** and then **Register** to create your new key.

Next, you will only have one chance to download the key you just generated.  Click **Download**.

![Download Key](sign-in-images/readme-key-download.png)

Also, take note of your **Key ID** at this step. This will be used for your `KeyId` later on.

You will have downloaded a `.p8` key file.  You can open this file in Notepad, or VSCode to see the text contents.  They should look something like:

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGTAgEAMBMGBasGSM49AgGFCCqGSM49AwEHBHkwdwIBAQQg3MX8n6VnQ2WzgEy0
Skoz9uOvatLMKTUIPyPCAejzzUCgCgYIKoZIzj0DAQehRANCAARZ0DoM6QPqpJxP
JKSlWz0AohFhYre10EXPkjrih4jTm+b0AeG2BGuoIWd18i8FimGDgK6IzHHPsEqj
DHF5Svq0
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Name this key `P8FileContents` and keep it in a safe place. You will use it when integrating this service into your mobile application.

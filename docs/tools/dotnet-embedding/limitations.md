# .NET Embedding Limitations

This document explains the limitations of .NET Embedding and, whenever possible, provides workarounds for them.

## General

### Use more than one embedded library in a project

It is not possible to have two Mono runtimes co-existing inside the same application. This means you cannot use two different .NET Embedding-generated libraries inside the same application.

**Workaround:** You can use the generator to create a single library that includes several assemblies (from different projects).

### Subclassing

.NET Embedding eases the integration of the Mono runtime inside applications by exposing a set of ready-to-use APIs for the target language and platform.

However this is not a two-way integration, e.g. you cannot subclass a managed type and expect managed code to call back inside your native code, since your managed code is unaware of this co-existance.

Depending on your needs, it might be possible to workaround parts of this limitation, e.g.

* your managed code can p/invoke into your native code. This requires customizing your managed code to allow customization from native code;

* use products like Xamarin.iOS and expose a managed library that would allow Objective-C (in this case) to subclass some managed NSObject subclasses.

## Objective-C generated code

### Nullability

There is no metadata in .NET that tell us if a null reference is acceptable or not for an API. Most APIs will throw `ArgumentNullException` if they cannot cope with a `null` argument. This is problematic as Objective-C handling of exceptions is something better avoided.

Since we cannot generate accurate nullability annotations in the header files and wish to minimize managed exceptions we default to non-null arguments (`NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN`) and add some specific, when precision is possible, nullability annotations.

### Bitcode (iOS)

Currently .NET Embedding does not support bitcode on iOS, which is enabled for some Xcode project templates. This will have to be disabled to successfully link generated frameworks.

* For iOS, bitcode is optional to submit apps to Apple's AppStore. Xamarin.iOS does not support it for iOS since the generated bitcode is “inline assembly”. This provides no benefit on the iOS platform because it can’t be optimized server-side, but makes binaries larger and build times longer.

* For tvOS and watchOS, bitcode is required for submitting apps to Apple's AppStore. Xamarin.iOS supports bitcode on tvOS (as "inline assembly") and watchOS (as "LLVM/IR") to fulfill this requirement.

* For macOS, bitcode support is currently not required, nor supported by Xamarin.Mac.

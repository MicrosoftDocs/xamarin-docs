## Reporting Bugs

Bugs should be reported directly via Visual Studio:

- **Help > Send Feedback > Report a Problem**

Please include all of the following information:

### Platform Version Information

This information is vital.

Visual Studio For Mac

- **Visual Studio > About Visual Studio > Show Details > Copy Information**
- Paste into bug report

Visual Studio

- **Help > About Visual Studio > Copy Info**
- Let us know your Operating System version and whether you are running 32-bit or 64-bit Windows.

### Log Files

Always attach both IDE and Inspector client log files.

Inspector client

- Mac: `~/Library/Logs/Xamarin/Inspector/Xamarin Inspector {date}.log`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Xamarin\Inspector\logs\Xamarin Inspector {date}.log`

1.4.x also features the ability to select the log file in Finder (macOS) or
Explorer (Windows) directly from the main menu:

- **Help > Reveal Log File**

Visual Studio For Mac

- `~/Library/Logs/VisualStudio/7.0/Ide.log`

Visual Studio

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Xamarin\Logs\{VS version}\Inspector {date}.log`
- The contents of the Visual Studio **Output** pane may also be informative.

### Project Settings

If you can attach the **.csproj** for the project you are trying to inspect,
it would be extremely helpful. This is easier than asking about individual settings.

Also please confirm that you are in Debug configuration.

### Selected Devices

For Android and iOS, it is vital that we know what device you are debugging on when
you want to inspect. We need to know:

- Name of device as shown in your IDE
- OS version of your device
- Android: Verify that you are using an x86 emulator
- Android: What emulator platform are you using? Google Emulator? Visual Studio Android Emulator? Xamarin Android Player?
- Does the app you are debugging properly appear and function in the device?
- Does the device have network connectivity (check via web browser)?

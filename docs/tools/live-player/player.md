> [!WARNING]
> The Xamarin Live Player Preview has ended. The app is no longer available. The instructions below are provided for customers continuing to use the preview with Visual Studio 2017.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the [XAML Previewer](~/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-previewer/index.md) in Visual Studio 2019 or 
> Visual Studio for Mac to view your screen designs as you edit them.

On startup, the Xamarin Live Player app looks like this:

When you press **Pair to Visual Studio**, use the camera to scan the
barcode showing on your computer:

If the connection is successful, the code should run on
the device almost immediately (such as the [Calculator sample](https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/tree/master/LivePlayer/BasicCalculator):

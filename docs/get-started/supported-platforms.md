# Xamarin.Forms supported platforms

Xamarin.Forms applications can be written for the following operating systems:

- iOS 9 or higher.
- Android 4.4 (API 19) or higher ([more details](#android-platform-support)). However, Android 5.0 (API 21) is recommended as the minimum API. This ensures full compatibility with all the Android support libraries, while still targeting the majority of Android devices.
- Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform.

Xamarin.Forms apps for iOS, Android, and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) can be built in Visual Studio. However, a networked Mac is required for iOS development using the latest version of Xcode and the minimum version of macOS specified by Apple. For more information, see [Windows requirements](~/cross-platform/get-started/requirements.md#windows-requirements).

Xamarin.Forms apps for iOS and Android can be built in Visual Studio for Mac. For more information, see [macOS requirements](~/cross-platform/get-started/requirements.md#macos-requirements).

> [!NOTE]
> Developing apps using Xamarin.Forms requires familiarity with [.NET Standard](~/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/net-standard.md).

## Additional platform support

Xamarin.Forms supports additional platforms beyond iOS, Android, and Windows:

- Samsung Tizen
- macOS
- GTK#
- WPF

The status of these platforms is available on the [Xamarin.Forms GitHub platform support wiki](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/wiki/Platform-Support).

## Android platform support

You should have the latest Android SDK Tools and Android API platform installed. You can update to the latest versions using the [Android SDK Manager](~/android/get-started/installation/android-sdk.md).

Additionally, the target/compile version for Android projects **must** be set to *Use latest installed platform*. However the minimum version can be set to API 19 so you can continue to support devices that use Android 4.4 and newer. These values are set in the **Project Options**:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/windows)

**Project Options > Application > Application Properties**

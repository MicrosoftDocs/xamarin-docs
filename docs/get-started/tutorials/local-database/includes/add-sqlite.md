# [Visual Studio](#tab/vswin)

To complete this tutorial you should have Visual Studio 2019 (latest release), with the **Mobile development with .NET** workload installed. In addition, you will require a paired Mac to build the tutorial application on iOS. For information about installing the Xamarin platform, see [Installing Xamarin](~/get-started/installation/index.md). For information about connecting Visual Studio 2019 to a Mac build host, see [Pair to Mac for Xamarin.iOS development](~/ios/get-started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/index.md).

1. Launch Visual Studio, and create a new blank Xamarin.Forms app named **LocalDatabaseTutorial**. Ensure that the app uses .NET Standard as the shared code mechanism.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The C# and XAML snippets in this tutorial requires that the solution is named **LocalDatabaseTutorial**. Using a different name will result in build errors when you copy code from this tutorial into the solution.

    For more information about the .NET Standard library that gets created, see [Anatomy of a Xamarin.Forms application](~/get-started/first-app/index.md) in the [Xamarin.Forms Quickstart Deep Dive](~/get-started/first-app/index.md).

1. In **Solution Explorer**, select the **LocalDatabaseTutorial** project, right-click and select **Manage NuGet Packages...**:

    > [!NOTE]
    > There are a number of NuGet packages with similar names. The correct package has these attributes:
    > - **Author(s):** Frank A. Krueger
    > - **Id:** sqlite-net-pcl
    > - **NuGet link:** [sqlite-net-pcl](https://www.nuget.org/packages/sqlite-net-pcl/)  
    >
    > Despite the package name, this NuGet package can be used in .NET Standard projects.

    This package will be used to incorporate database operations into the application.

1. Build the solution to ensure there are no errors.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/vsmac)

To complete this tutorial you should have Visual Studio for Mac (latest release), with iOS and Android platform support installed. In addition, you will also require Xcode (latest release).

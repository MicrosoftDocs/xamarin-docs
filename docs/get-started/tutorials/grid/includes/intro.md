Before attempting this tutorial, you should have successfully completed the:

- [Build your first Xamarin.Forms app](~/get-started/first-app/index.md) quickstart.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create a Xamarin.Forms [`Grid`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Grid) in XAML.
> - Specify columns and rows for the `Grid`.
> - Span content across multiple columns or multiple rows in the `Grid`.

You will use Visual Studio 2019, or Visual Studio for Mac, to create a simple application that demonstrates how to layout controls within a [`Grid`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Grid). The following screenshots show the final application:

[![Screenshot of a Grid that has content that spans multiple columns and rows, on iOS and Android](../images/span-columns-rows.png "Grid with content spanning columns and rows")](../images/span-columns-rows-large.png#lightbox "Grid with content spanning columns and rows")

You'll also use [XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms](~/xamarin-forms/xaml/hot-reload.md) to see UI changes without rebuilding your application.

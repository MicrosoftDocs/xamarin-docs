Before attempting this tutorial, you should have successfully completed the:

- [Build your first Xamarin.Forms app](~/get-started/first-app/index.md) quickstart.
- [StackLayout](~/get-started/tutorials/stacklayout/index.yml) tutorial.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create a Xamarin.Forms [`Button`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Button) in XAML.
> - Respond to the `Button` being tapped.
> - Change the appearance of the `Button`.

You will use Visual Studio 2019, or Visual Studio for Mac, to create a simple application that demonstrates how to customize a [`Button`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Button). The following screenshots show the final application:

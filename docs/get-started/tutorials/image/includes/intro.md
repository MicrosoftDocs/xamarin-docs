Before attempting this tutorial, you should have successfully completed the:

- [Build your first Xamarin.Forms app](~/get-started/first-app/index.md) quickstart.
- [StackLayout](~/get-started/tutorials/stacklayout/index.yml) tutorial.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create a Xamarin.Forms [`Image`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Image) in XAML.
> - Customize the `Image` appearance.
> - Display a local image file from each platform project.

You will use Visual Studio 2019, or Visual Studio for Mac, to create a simple application that demonstrates how to display an image and customize its appearance. The following screenshots show the final application:

[![Screenshot of an Image view displaying a local image, on iOS and Android](../images/local-file.png "Image view displaying a local image")](../images/local-file-large.png#lightbox "Image view displaying a local image")

You'll also use [XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms](~/xamarin-forms/xaml/hot-reload.md) to see UI changes without rebuilding your application.

Xamarin.Forms has a modal pop-up, known as an alert, to alert the user, or to ask simple questions of them. In this exercise, you will use the [`DisplayAlert`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page.DisplayAlert*) method, from the [`Page`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page) class, to display an alert to the user, and to ask a simple question.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/vswin)

To complete this tutorial you should have Visual Studio 2019 (latest release), with the **Mobile development with .NET** workload installed. In addition, you will require a paired Mac to build the tutorial application on iOS. For information about installing the Xamarin platform, see [Installing Xamarin](~/get-started/installation/index.md). For information about connecting Visual Studio 2019 to a Mac build host, see [Pair to Mac for Xamarin.iOS development](~/ios/get-started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/index.md).

1. Launch Visual Studio, and create a new blank Xamarin.Forms app named **PopupsTutorial**. Ensure that the app uses .NET Standard as the shared code mechanism.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The C# and XAML snippets in this tutorial requires that the solution is named **PopupsTutorial**. Using a different name will result in build errors when you copy code from this tutorial into the solution.

    For more information about the .NET Standard library that gets created, see [Anatomy of a Xamarin.Forms application](~/get-started/first-app/index.md) in the [Xamarin.Forms Quickstart Deep Dive](~/get-started/first-app/index.md).

1. In **Solution Explorer**, in the **PopupsTutorial** project, double-click **MainPage.xaml** to open it. Then, in **MainPage.xaml**, remove all of the template code and replace it with the following code:

    ```xaml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
                 xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
                 x:Class="PopupsTutorial.MainPage">
        <StackLayout Margin="20,35,20,20">
            <Button Text="Display alert"
                    Clicked="OnDisplayAlertButtonClicked" />
            <Button Text="Display alert question"
                    Clicked="OnDisplayAlertQuestionButtonClicked" />
        </StackLayout>
    </ContentPage>
    ```

    This code declaratively defines the user interface for the page, which consists of two [`Button`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Button) objects in a [`StackLayout`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.StackLayout). The [`Button.Text`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Button.Text) properties specify the text that appears in each `Button`, and the [`Clicked`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Button.Clicked) events are set to event handlers that will be created in the next step.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, in the **PopupsTutorial** project, expand **MainPage.xaml** and double-click **MainPage.xaml.cs** to open it. Then, in **MainPage.xaml.cs**, add the `OnDisplayAlertButtonClicked` and `OnDisplayAlertQuestionButtonClicked` event handlers to the class:

    ```csharp
    async void OnDisplayAlertButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        await DisplayAlert("Alert", "This is an alert.", "OK");
    }

    async void OnDisplayAlertQuestionButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        bool response = await DisplayAlert("Save?", "Would you like to save your data?", "Yes", "No");
        Console.WriteLine("Save data: " + response);
    }
    ```

    When a [`Button`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Button) is tapped, the respective event handler method is executed. The `OnDisplayAlertButtonClicked` method calls the [`DisplayAlert`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page.DisplayAlert*) method, to display a modal alert with a single cancel button. Once the alert is dismissed the user can continue interacting with the application.

    The `OnDisplayAlertQuestionButtonClicked` method calls an overload of the [`DisplayAlert`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page.DisplayAlert*) method, to display a modal alert with an accept button and a cancel button. After the user selects one of the buttons, the selection is returned as a `boolean`.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The [`DisplayAlert`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Page.DisplayAlert*) method is asynchronous, and should always be awaited with the `await` keyword.

1. In the Visual Studio toolbar, press the **Start** button (the triangular button that resembles a Play button) to launch the application inside your chosen remote iOS simulator or Android emulator. Then, tap the first [`Button`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Button):

    [![Screenshot of an alert on iOS and Android](../images/alert.png "Alert")](../images/alert-large.png#lightbox "Alert")

    After dismissing the alert, tap the second [`Button`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Button):

    [![Screenshot of an alert that asks a question, on iOS and Android](../images/alert-question.png "Alert that asks a question")](../images/alert-question-large.png#lightbox "Alert that asks a question")

    Observe that, after selecting a response to the question, the response is output to the Visual Studio **Output** window.

    For more information about displaying alerts, see [Display an alert](~/xamarin-forms/user-interface/pop-ups.md#display-an-alert) in the [Display Pop-ups](~/xamarin-forms/user-interface/pop-ups.md) guide.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/vsmac)

To complete this tutorial you should have Visual Studio for Mac (latest release), with iOS and Android platform support installed. In addition, you will also require Xcode (latest release).

This series of tutorials has covered the basics of creating mobile applications with Xamarin.Forms. To learn more about Xamarin.Forms development, read about the following functionality:

- There are four main control groups used to create the user interface of a Xamarin.Forms application. For more information, see [Controls Reference](~/xamarin-forms/user-interface/controls/index.md).
- Data binding is a technique for linking properties of two objects so that changes in one property are automatically reflected in the other property. For more information, see [Data Binding](~/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/data-binding/index.md).
- Xamarin.Forms provides multiple page navigation experiences, depending upon the page type being used. For more information, see [Navigation](~/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/navigation/index.md).
- Styles help to reduce repetitive markup, and allow an applications appearance to be more easily changed. For more information, see [Styling Xamarin.Forms Apps](~/xamarin-forms/user-interface/styles/index.md).
- XAML markup extensions extend the power and flexibility of XAML by allowing element attributes to be set from sources other than literal text strings. For more information, see [XAML Markup Extensions](~/xamarin-forms/xaml/markup-extensions/index.md).
- Data templates provide the ability to define the presentation of data on supported views. For more information, see [Data Templates](~/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/templates/data-templates/index.md).
- Each page, layout, and view is rendered differently on each platform using a `Renderer` class that in turn creates a native control, arranges it on the screen, and adds the behavior specified in the shared code. Developers can implement their own custom `Renderer` classes to customize the appearance and/or behavior of a control. For more information, see [Custom Renderers](~/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/custom-renderer/index.md).
- Effects also allow the native controls on each platform to be customized. Effects are created in platform-specific projects by subclassing the [`PlatformEffect`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.PlatformEffect`2) class, and are consumed by attaching them to an appropriate Xamarin.Forms control. For more information, see [Effects](~/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/effects/index.md).
- Shared code can access native functionality through the [`DependencyService`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.DependencyService) class. For more information, see [Accessing Native Features with DependencyService](~/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/dependency-service/index.md).

Alternatively, [_Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms_](~/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/index.md), a book by Charles Petzold, is a good place to learn more about Xamarin.Forms. The book is available as a PDF or in a variety of ebook formats.

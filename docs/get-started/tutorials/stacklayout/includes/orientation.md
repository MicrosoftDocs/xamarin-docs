# [Visual Studio](#tab/vswin)

1. In **MainPage.xaml**, modify the [`StackLayout`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.StackLayout) declaration so it aligns its children horizontally, instead of vertically:

    ```xaml
    <StackLayout Margin="20,35,20,25"
                 Orientation="Horizontal">
        <Label Text="The StackLayout has its Margin property set, to control the rendering position of the StackLayout." />
        <Label Text="The Padding property can be set to specify the distance between the StackLayout and its children." />
        <Label Text="The Spacing property can be set to specify the distance between views in the StackLayout." />
    </StackLayout>
    ```

    This code sets the [`Orientation`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.StackLayout.Orientation) property to [`Horizontal`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.StackOrientation.Horizontal).

1. In the Visual Studio toolbar, press the **Start** button (the triangular button that resembles a Play button) to launch the application inside your chosen remote iOS simulator or Android emulator:

    Note that the [`Label`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Label) instances within the [`StackLayout`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.StackLayout) are now aligned horizontally, instead of vertically.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/vsmac)

1. In **MainPage.xaml**, modify the [`StackLayout`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.StackLayout) declaration so it aligns its children horizontally, instead of vertically:

    ```xaml
    <StackLayout Margin="20,35,20,25"
                 Orientation="Horizontal">
        <Label Text="The StackLayout has its Margin property set, to control the rendering position of the StackLayout." />
        <Label Text="The Padding property can be set to specify the distance between the StackLayout and its children." />
        <Label Text="The Spacing property can be set to specify the distance between views in the StackLayout." />
    </StackLayout>
    ```

    This code sets the [`Orientation`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.StackLayout.Orientation) property to [`Horizontal`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.StackOrientation.Horizontal).

1. In the Visual Studio for Mac toolbar, press the **Start** button (the triangular button that resembles a Play button) to launch the application inside your chosen iOS simulator or Android emulator:

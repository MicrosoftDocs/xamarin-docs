Before attempting this tutorial, you should have successfully completed the:

- [Build your first Xamarin.Forms app](~/get-started/first-app/index.md) quickstart.
- [StackLayout](~/get-started/tutorials/stacklayout/index.yml) tutorial.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create a Xamarin.Forms [`Editor`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Editor) in XAML.
> - Respond to the text in the `Editor` changing.
> - Customize the behavior of the `Editor`.

You will use Visual Studio 2019, or Visual Studio for Mac, to create a simple application that demonstrates how to customize the behavior of an [`Editor`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Editor). The following screenshots show the final application:

You'll also use [XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms](~/xamarin-forms/xaml/hot-reload.md) to see UI changes without rebuilding your application.

Before attempting this tutorial, you should have successfully completed the:

- [Build your first Xamarin.Forms app](~/get-started/first-app/index.md) quickstart.
- [StackLayout](~/get-started/tutorials/stacklayout/index.yml) tutorial.
- [Entry](~/get-started/tutorials/entry/index.yml) tutorial.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Respond to an application starting, sleeping, or resuming.
> - Persist data across lifecycle state changes.

You will use Visual Studio 2019, or Visual Studio for Mac, to create a simple application that demonstrates how to persist data across lifecycle state changes. The following screenshots show the final application:

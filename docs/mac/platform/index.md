Refer to the [Troubleshooting page](~/cross-platform/macios/binding/troubleshooting.md)
to resolve any issues.

## [Introduction to OpenTK](~/mac/platform/opentk.md)

OpenTK (The Open Toolkit) is an advanced, low-level C# library that makes working with OpenGL, OpenCL and OpenAL easier. OpenTK can be used for games, scientific applications or other projects that require 3D graphics, audio or computational functionality. This article gives a brief introduction to using OpenTK in a Xamarin.Mac app.

## [Introduction to storyboards](~/mac/platform/storyboards/index.md)

Storyboards allow you to develop a User Interface for your Xamarin.Mac app that not only includes the window definitions and controls, but also contains the links between different windows (via segues) and view states. This article gives an introduction to using Storyboards in a Xamarin.Mac app.

## [Xamarin.Mac extension support](~/mac/platform/extensions.md)

In Xamarin.Mac 2.10 preview support was added for multiple macOS extension points:

- Finder

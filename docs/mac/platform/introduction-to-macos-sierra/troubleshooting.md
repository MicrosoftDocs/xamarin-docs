# Xamarin.Mac - macOS Sierra Troubleshooting

_This article provides several troubleshooting tips for working with macOS Sierra in Xamarin.Mac apps._

The following sections list some known issues that can occur when using macOS Sierra with Xamarin.Mac and the solution to those issues:

- [App Store](#App-Store)
- [Apple Pay](#Apple-Pay)
- [Binary Compatibility](#Binary-Compatibility)
- [CFNetwork HTTP Protocol](#CFNetwork-HTTP-Protocol)
- [CloudKit](#CloudKit)
- [Core Image](#CoreImage)
- [Notifications](#Notifications)
- [NSUserActivity](#NSUserActivity)
- [Safari](#Safari)

<a name="App-Store" />

## App Store

Known Issues:

- When testing In-App Purchases in the sandbox environment, the authentication dialog may appear twice.
- When testing In-App Purchases with hosted content in the sandbox environment, the password dialog will appear every time the app is brought to the foreground until the content download completes.

<a name="Apple-Pay" />

## Apple Pay

If an incorrect expiration date or security code (CW) is entered when adding a new payment card to Apple Pay, the card provisioning process will be terminated.

<a name="Binary-Compatibility" />

## Binary Compatibility

Known Issues:

- Calling `NSObject.ValueForKey` will a `null` key will result in an exception.
- Both `NSURLSession` and `NSURLConnection` no longer RC4 cipher suites during the TLS handshake for `http://` URLs.
- Apps can hang if they modify a superview's geometry in either the `ViewWillLayoutSubviews` or `LayoutSubviews` methods.
- For all SSL/TLS connections, the RC4 symmetric cipher is now disabled by default. Additionally, the Secure Transport API no longer supports SSLv3 and it is recommended that the app stop using SHA-1 and 3DES cryptography as soon as possible.

<a name="CFNetwork-HTTP-Protocol" />

## CFNetwork HTTP Protocol

The `HTTPBodyStream` property of the `NSMutableURLRequest` class must be set to an unopened stream since `NSURLConnection` and `NSURLSession` now strictly enforce this requirement.

<a name="CloudKit" />

## CloudKit

Long running operations will return a _"You don't have permission to save the file."_ error.

<a name="CoreImage" />

## Core Image

The `CIImageProcessor` API now supports an arbitrary input image count. `CIImageProcessor` API that was included in macOS Sierra beta 1 will be removed.

<a name="Notifications" />

## Notifications

When working with Notification Content Extensions, View Controllers are not being correctly released and might result in a crash when Extension memory limits are reached.

<a name="NSUserActivity" />

## NSUserActivity

After a Handoff operation, the `UserInfo` property of a `NSUserActivity` object might be empty. Explicitly call `BecomeCurrent` `NSUserActivity` object as a current workaround.

<a name="Safari" />

## Safari

WebGeolocation requires a secure (`https://`) URL to work on both iOS 10 and macOS Sierra to prevent malicious use of location data.

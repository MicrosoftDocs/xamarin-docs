<a name="AVFoundation-Framework-Enhancements" />

## AVFoundation Framework Enhancements

The following enhancement have been made to the AVFoundation Framework for macOS Sierra:

- In macOS, the app no longer has to implement different [AVPlayerItem](https://developer.apple.com/reference/avfoundation/avplayeritem) behaviors based on content type. Simply set the `Rate` property and AVFoundation will determine when enough content is available for playback without stalling.
- The new `AVPlayerLooper` class makes it easier to loop a given piece of media during playback.
- The `AVAssetDownloadURLSession` class allows for the downloading and later playback of FairPlay encrypted HLS streams.

<a name="Core-Data-Framework-Enhancements" />

## Core Data Framework Enhancements

The following enhancement have been made to the Core Data Framework for macOS Sierra:

- Root [NSManagedObjectContext](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontext) objects supports concurrent faulting and fetching without serialization.
- The [NSPersistentStoreCoordinator](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coredata/nspersistentstorecoordinator) class maintains a pool of SQLite data stores.
- The [NSManagedObjectContext](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontext) objects with SQLite data stores in the WAL Journal Mode support the new query generation feature where Managed Object Contexts (MOC) can be pinned to specific database versions for future fetching and faulting transactions.
- Using the high-level `NSPersistenceContainer` to reference the `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator`, [NSManagedObjectModel](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coredata/nsmanagedobjectmodel) and other Core Data configuration resources.
- Several new convenience methods have been added to `NSManagedObject` making it easier to perform fetches and create subclasses.

For more information, please see Apple's [Core Data Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coredata).

<a name="Core-Image-Framework-Enhancements" />

## Core Image Framework Enhancements

The following enhancement have been made to the Core Image Framework for macOS Sierra:

- The `ImageWithExtent` method of the [CIFilter](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coreimage/cifilter) class can be used to insert custom processing into the filter operation. Core Image will invoke the given callback between filters when processing an image for output or display.
- The app can now process images in a color space outside of the Core Image context's working color space by converting in and out of the color space before and after processing.
- The Core Image kernel can now request a specific pixel output format.
- The following new image filters have been added: `CINinePartTitled`, `CINinePartStretched`, `CIHueSaturationValueGradient`, `CIEdgePreserveUpsampleFilter` and `CIClamp`.

<a name="GameKit-Framework-Enhancements" />

## GameKit Framework Enhancements

The following enhancement have been made to the GameKit Framework for macOS Sierra:

- The **Game Center App** has been deprecated and removed from macOS. If the app uses GameKit, it _must_ present its own interface to display GameKit features such as leaderboards, etc. 
- A new iCloud-only account type has been implemented by the [GKCloudPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/reference/gamekit/gkcloudplayer) class.
- The new [GKGameSession](https://developer.apple.com/reference/gamekit/gkgamesession) class provides a generalized solution for managing persistent data storage on Game Center. `GKGameSession` maintains a list of players and the app is responsible form implementing how and when participant date is stored, retrieved or exchanged between players. In many instances Game Sessions can replace existing turn-based matches, real-time matches or persistent game save methods.

<a name="GamePlayKit-Framework-Enhancements" />

## GamePlayKit Framework Enhancements

- The USD file format is now supported.
- Use the new `MDLMaterialPropertyGraph` class to easily support runtime changes to models.
- Signed Distance Field support has been added to the [MDLVoxelArray](https://developer.apple.com/reference/modelio/mdlvoxelarray) class.
- Use the new `MDLLightProbeIrradianceDataSource` class to assist in Light Probe placement.

<a name="Photos-Framework-Enhancements" />

## Photos Framework Enhancements

The following enhancement have been made to the Photos Framework for macOS Sierra:

- Live Photo editing is now available for apps that support the Photos framework and to photo editing extensions (for use inside of the Photos and Camera apps).
- Use the new [PHLivePhotoEditingContext](https://developer.apple.com/reference/photos/phlivephotoeditingcontext) class to apply edits to both the video and still content of Live Photos.
- Use the [CIImageProcessorInput](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coreimage/ciimageprocessorinput) and [CIImageProcessorOutput](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coreimage/ciimageprocessoroutput) classes to take advantage of the new Core Image processor feature to perform edits.
- To support Live Photos, the [PHLivePhoto](https://developer.apple.com/reference/photos/phlivephoto) and [PHLivePhotoView](https://developer.apple.com/reference/photosui/phlivephotoview) classes have been ported from iOS to macOS.

<a name="SceneKit-Framework-Enhancements" />

## SceneKit Framework Enhancements

The following enhancement have been made to the SceneKit Framework for macOS Sierra:

- Now includes a new Physically Based Rendering (PBR) system for more realistic results with simpler asset authoring.
- Use the new [SCNLightingModelPhysicallyBased](https://developer.apple.com/reference/scenekit/scnlightingmodelphysicallybased) shading model to product a wide range of realistic shading effects while requiring only three fundamental properties (`Diffuse`, `Metalness` and `Roughness`).
- Since PBR shading works best with environment-based lighting, use the `LightingEnvironment` property to assign image-based lighting to tan entire scene.
- Use the `IESProfileURL` property to import real-world light fixtures that define lighting base on real-world values such as intensity (in lumens) and color temperature (in degrees Kelvin).
- The [SCNCamera](https://developer.apple.com/reference/scenekit/scncamera) class can provide greater realism by using HDR features and effects. Use adaptive exposure to create automatic effects or use vignetting, color fringing and color grading to add filmatic effects to the game.
- Both PBR and HDR camera features provide better results than traditional rendering techniques and, as a result, SceneKit now performs all color calculations in a linear color space (using P3 color gamut on wide-color device displays).
- SceneKit now color matches all colors by reading the color profile information.
- SceneKit interprets color component values in a linear RGB color space for all shader types.
- Since SceneKit reads and adjust for color profile information in texture images, use Asset Catalogs for all images to ensure this information is provided.
- Both linear color space rendering and wide-color can be disabled by specifying the `SCNDisableLinearSpaceRendering` and `SCNDisableWideGamut` keys in the app's `Info.plist`.
- Build arbitrary polygon primates (either loaded from files or generated programmatically) to specify geometry with the new [SCNGeometryPrimitiveTypePolygon](https://developer.apple.com/reference/scenekit/1772322-scenekit_enumerations/scngeometryprimitivetype/scngeometryprimitivetypepolygon) class.

<a name="Security-Framework-Enhancements" />

## Security Framework Enhancements

The following enhancement have been made to the Security Framework for macOS Sierra:

- The `SecKey` interface has been modernized and unified across all platforms (iOS, tvOS, watchOS and macOS).

<a name="SpriteKit-Framework-Enhancements" />

## SpriteKit Framework Enhancements

The following enhancement have been made to the SpriteKit Framework for macOS Sierra:

- Tilemaps now support square, hexagonal and isometric tile shapes for 2D, 2.5D and side-scrolling games using the `SKTileMapMode`, `SKTileGroup`, `SKTileGroupRule` and `SKTileSet` classes.
- Use the new `SKWarpGeometry` class to stretch or distort [SKSpriteNode](https://developer.apple.com/reference/spritekit/skspritenode) or [SKEffectNode](https://developer.apple.com/reference/spritekit/skeffectnode) rendering. The new [SKAction](https://developer.apple.com/reference/spritekit/skaction) class can be used to animate transitions between warp effects.
- Custom shaders can provide attributes (`SKAttribute`) that can be configured separately by each node that uses the shader by supplying an Attribute Value (`SKAttributeValue`).
- The [SKView](https://developer.apple.com/reference/spritekit/skview) class provides several new methods to give fine-grained control over when and how a scene is rendered.

<a name="New-Frameworks" />

## New Frameworks

The following frameworks have been added to macOS Sierra:

- **Intents Framework** - This framework allow the app to examine interactions (such as location or user actions), and take action based on that information.
- **SafariServices Framework** - This framework allow the app to develop app extensions for Safari (such as content blockers) for both macOS and iOS.

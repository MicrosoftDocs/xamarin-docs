# Playing sound with AVAudioPlayer in Xamarin.Mac

## About the AVAudioPlayer

The `AVAudioPlayer` class is used to playback audio data from either memory or a file. Apple recommends using this class to play audio in your app unless you are doing network streaming or require low latency audio I/O.

You can use the `AVAudioPlayer` class to do the following:

- Play sounds of any duration with optional looping.
- Play multiple sounds at the same time with optional synchronization.
- Control volume, playback rate and stereo positioning for each sounds playing.
- Support features such as fast forward or rewind.
- Obtain playback level metering data.

`AVAudioPlayer` supports sounds in any audio format provided by iOS, tvOS and macOS such as .aif, .wav or .mp3.

## Playing sounds in macOS

Because macOS supports the same Audio Toolbox classes as iOS, please see our iOS [Playing Sound with AVAudioPlayer](https://github.com/xamarin/recipes/tree/master/Recipes/ios/media/sound/avaudioplayer) documentation for the full details of playing audio in a Xamarin.Mac app.

# Upload to Mac App Store

_This guide walks through uploading a Xamarin.Mac app for publication to the Mac App Store._

Applications are submitted for Mac App Store approval via [iTunes Connect](http://itunesconnect.apple.com/).

previously:

3. Select the availability date and price. Regardless of the availability
date the developer selects, the app will only become available for sale after it has been approved. This value can be set far in the future if the developer wants more control over the actual availability date:

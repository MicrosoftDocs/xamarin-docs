# Debugging a native crash in a Xamarin.Mac app

## Overview

Sometimes programming errors can cause crashes in the native Objective-C runtime. Unlike C# exceptions, these don't point to a specific line in your code you can look to fix. Sometimes they can be trivial to find and fix, and other times they can be extremely difficult to track down. 

Let's walk through a few real native crash examples and take a look.

## Example 1: Assertion failure

Here is the first few lines of a crash in a simple test application (this information will be in the **Application Output** Pad):

```csharp
2014-10-15 16:18:02.364 NSOutlineViewHottness[79111:1304993] *** Assertion failure in -[NSTableView _uncachedRectHeightOfRow:], /SourceCache/AppKit/AppKit-1343.13/TableView.subproj/NSTableView.m:1855
2014-10-15 16:18:02.364 NSOutlineViewHottness[79111:1304993] NSTableView variable rowHeight error: The value must be > 0 for row 0, but the delegate <NSOutlineViewHottness_HotnessViewDelegate: 0xaa01860> gave -1.000.
2014-10-15 16:18:02.378 NSOutlineViewHottness[79111:1304993] *** Assertion failure in -[NSTableView _uncachedRectHeightOfRow:], /SourceCache/AppKit/AppKit-1343.13/TableView.subproj/NSTableView.m:1855
2014-10-15 16:18:02.378 NSOutlineViewHottness[79111:1304993] NSTableView variable rowHeight error: The value must be > 0 for row 0, but the delegate <NSOutlineViewHottness_HotnessViewDelegate: 0xaa01860> gave -1.000.
2014-10-15 16:18:02.381 NSOutlineViewHottness[79111:1304993] (

```

The lines prefixed with numbers is the native stack trace. From that you can see the crash occurred somewhere inside `NSTableView` handling the row heights. Then `NSAssertionHandler` fires an `NSException (objc_exception_throw)` and we see the Assertion failure:

```csharp
rowHeight error: The value must be > 0 for row 0, but the delegate
<NSOutlineView_ViewDelegate: 0xaa01860> gave -1.000
```

Once you see this, it’s pretty clear that some `NSOutlineViewDelegate` method is returning a negative number. This was the problem:

```csharp
public override nfloat GetRowHeight (NSTableView tableView, nint row)
{
	return -1;
}
```

## Example 2: Callback jumped into middle of nowhere

```csharp
Stacktrace:

This is an issue that was much more difficult to track down. When you see `at <unknown> <0xffffffff>` or `MonoMac.ObjCRuntime.Runtime.GetNSObject (IntPtr ptr)`  at the top of the managed stack trace, it suggests we are trying to execute some managed code with an object that has been garbage collected. The native stack trace shows `trackMouse:inRect:ofView:untilMouseUp` into `NSCell _sendActionFrom` so we are somewhere handling a click event, trying to call back into C# and dying.

In general, errors like this are difficult to track down. I added `GC.Collect(2)` to a button handler to help track down this issue (forcing a garbage collection) to make the issue reproducible. After bisecting the example for a while, removing sections of code until the issue disappeared, it turned out to be [this bug](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=23378):

```csharp
mainWindowController.Window.StandardWindowButton (NSWindowButton.CloseButton).Activated += HandleActivated;
```

The `NSButton` returned by `StandardWindowButton()` was being collected even though an event was registered to it (that's the bug). When we try to call that event by clicking, if the button has been garbage collected we crash.

Although it wasn't the root cause of this particular issue, stack traces like this can also be caused by incorrect method signatures in functions `[Export]`ed to Objective-C. For example, if a method expects a parameter to be an `out string` and you type it as `string`, we can crash in the same way.

## Example 3: Callbacks and managed objects

Many Cocoa APIs involve being “called back” by the library when some event occurs, giving you a chance to respond, or when some data is needed to carry out a task. Though you may think primarily of the **Delegate** and **DataSource** patterns, there are a multitude of APIs that work this way. For example, when you override the methods of an `NSView` and then insert it into the visual tree, you expect AppKit to call you back when certain events occur.

In almost all cases, Xamarin.Mac will correctly prevent the managed object target of these callbacks from being Garbage Collected while they still could be called back. However, rarely bugs in the binding can disrupt this. When this happens, you can see unpleasant crashes similar to this:

```csharp

12  com.apple.AppKit                    0x9a01eb0d -[NSToolbar _windowWillShowToolbar] + 79

```

This guide will help you track down bugs of this nature if they crop up, correctly report them so they can be fixed, and work around them in your code until then.

### Locating

In almost every case with bugs of this nature, the primary symptom is native crashes, normally with something similar to `mono_sigsegv_signal_handler`, or `_sigtrap` in the top frames of the stack. Cocoa is attempting to call back into your C# code, hitting a garbage collected object, and crashing. However, not every crash with these symbols is caused by a binding issue like this, you’ll need to do some additional digging to confirm this is the problem. 

What makes these bugs difficult to track down is that they only occur **after** a garbage collection has disposed of the object in question. If you believe you’ve hit one of these bugs, add the following code somewhere in your startup sequence:

```csharp
new System.Threading.Thread (() => 
{
    while (true) {
         System.Threading.Thread.Sleep (1000);
         GC.Collect ();
    }
}).Start (); 
```

This will force your application to run the garbage collector every second. Re-run your application and try to reproduce the bug. If you crash immediately, or consistently instead of randomly, you are on the right track.

### Reporting

The next step is to report the issue to Xamarin so the binding can be fixed for future releases. If you are a business or enterprise license holder, open a ticket at 

[http://xamarin.com/support](http://xamarin.com/support)

Otherwise, search for an existing issue:

- Check the [Xamarin.Mac Forums](https://forums.xamarin.com/categories/mac)
- Search the [issue repository](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues)
- Before switching to GitHub issues, Xamarin issues were tracked on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/describecomponents.cgi). Please search there for matching issues.
- If you cannot find a matching issue, please file a new issue in the [GitHub issue repository](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/new).

GitHub issues are all public. It’s not possible to hide comments or attachments. 

Please include as much of the following as possible:

- A simple example reproducing the issue. This is **invaluable** where possible. 
- The full stack trace of the crash.
- The C# code surrounding the crash.   

### Working around

Once you’ve tracked down the issue, patching the issue with a work around until the binding can be fixed can be simple. The aim is to prevent the object (**View**, **Delegate**, **DataSource**) that is incorrectly being disposed from leaving memory by keeping an open reference.

For simple cases where there is only a single instance of the object, change the code from this:

```csharp
void AddObject ()
{
	item.View = new MyView ();
	...
}
```

To using a static variable such as this:

```csharp
static NSObject view;
...

void AddObject ()
{
 	view = new MyView ();
 	item.View = view;
	...
}
```

In cases where multiple instances may be created, a static `HashSet` can be employed:

```csharp
static HashSet<NSObject> collection = new HashSet<NSObject> ();
...

void AddObject ()
{
 	item.View = new MyView ();
	collection.Add (item.View );
	...
}
```

Once the binding has been fixed and you’ve upgrade to the version of Xamarin.Mac that includes the fix, the work-around code can be removed.

## Exception bubbling and Objective-C

You should never allow a C# Exception to "escape" managed code to the calling Objective-C method. If you do, the results are undefined but generally involve crashing. In general, we do everything we can to bubble up useful information for both
native and managed crashes to help you solve your issues quickly.

Without getting too bogged down with the technical reasons why, setting up the
infrastructure to catch managed exceptions at every managed/native boundary is
non-trivially expensive and there are a _lot_ of transitions that happen in
many common operations. Many operations, specifically ones that involve the UI
thread must finish quickly or your app will stutter and have unacceptable
performance characteristics. Many of those callbacks do very simple things that
rarely have the possibility of throwing, so this overhead would both be
expensive and unnecessary in those cases.

Thus, we'd don't set up those try / catches for you. For places where you code
does non-trivial things (beyond say returning a booleans or simple math), you
can try catch yourself.

# User Interfaces with Xamarin.Android

The following sections explain the various tools and building blocks
that are used to compose user interfaces in Xamarin.Android apps.

## [Android Designer](~/android/user-interface/android-designer/index.md)

This section explains how to use the Android Designer to lay out controls
visually and edit properties. It also explains how to use the Designer
to work with user interfaces and resources across various
configurations, such as themes, languages, and device configurations,
as well as how to design for alternative views like landscape and
portrait.

## [Material Theme](~/android/user-interface/material-theme.md)

*Material Theme* is the user interface style that determines the look
and feel of views and activities in Android. Material Theme is built
into Android, so it is used by the system UI as well as by
applications. This guide introduces Material Design principles and
explains how to theme an app using either built-in Material Themes
or a custom theme.

## [User Profile](~/android/user-interface/user-profile.md)

This guide explains how to access the personal profile for the owner of
a device, including contact data such as the device owner's name and
phone number.

## [Splash Screen](~/android/user-interface/splash-screen.md)

An Android app takes some time to start up, especially when the app
is first launched on a device. A splash screen may display start up
progress to the user. This guide explains how to create a splash
screen for your app.

## [Layouts](~/android/user-interface/layouts/index.md)

Layouts are used to define the visual structure for a user interface.
Layouts such as `ListView` and `RecyclerView` are the most fundamental
building blocks of Android applications. Typically, a layout will use
an `Adapter` to act as a bridge from the layout to the underlying data
that is used to populate data items in the layout. This section
explains how to use layouts such as `LinearLayout`, `RelativeLayout`,
`TableLayout`, `RecyclerView`, and `GridView`.

## [Controls](~/android/user-interface/controls/index.md)

Android controls (also called *widgets*) are the UI elements that you
use to build a user interface. This section explains how to use
controls such as buttons, toolbars, date/time pickers, calendars,
spinners, switches, pop-up menus, view pagers, and web views.

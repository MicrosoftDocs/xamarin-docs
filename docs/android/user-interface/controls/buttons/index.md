# Buttons in Xamarin.Android

The `Button` class is used to represent various different styles of
button in Android screens. This section introduces the different
options for working with buttons in Xamarin.Android:

- [RadioButton](~/android/user-interface/controls/buttons/radio-button.md)
    allows the user to select one option from a set.

- [ToggleButton](~/android/user-interface/controls/buttons/toggle-button.md)
    allow the user to flip (toggle) a setting between two states.

- [CheckBox](~/android/user-interface/controls/buttons/check-box.md)
    is a special type of button that can be either checked
    or unchecked to indicate one of two possible states.

- You can also create a
    [custom button](~/android/user-interface/controls/buttons/custom-button.md)
    that uses an image instead of text.

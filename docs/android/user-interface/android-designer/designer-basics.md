# Xamarin.Android Designer basics

_This topic introduces Xamarin.Android Designer features, explains how
to launch the Designer, describes the Design Surface, and details how
to use the Properties pane to edit widget properties._

# [Visual Studio](#tab/windows)

## Launching the Designer

The Designer is launched automatically when a layout is created, or it
can be launched by double-clicking an existing layout file. For example,
double-clicking **activity_main.axml** in the **Resources > Layout** folder will
load the Designer as seen in this screenshot:

[![Designer screen in Visual Studio](designer-basics-images/vs/01-open-designer-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/01-open-designer.png#lightbox)

Likewise, you can add a new layout by right-clicking the **layout**
folder in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Add > New Item... > Android Layout**:

[![Add New Item dialog](designer-basics-images/vs/02-add-new-layout-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/02-add-new-layout.png#lightbox)

This creates a new **.axml** layout file and loads it into the Designer.

> [!TIP]
> Newer releases of Visual Studio support opening .xml files inside the Android Designer.
>
> Both .axml and .xml files are supported in the Android Designer.

## Designer features

The Designer is composed of several sections that support its various
features, as shown in the following screenshot:

[![Diagram of Designer panes](designer-basics-images/vs/03-designer-features-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/03-designer-features.png#lightbox)

When you edit a layout in the Designer, you use the following features
to create and shape your design:

- **Design Surface** &ndash; Facilitates the visual construction of
    the user interface by giving you an editable representation of how
    the layout will appear on the device. The **Design Surface** is
    displayed inside the **Design Pane** (with the **Designer Toolbar**
    positioned above it).

- **Source Pane** &ndash; Provides a view of the underlying XML source
    that corresponds to the design presented on the **Design Surface**.

- **Designer Toolbar** &ndash; Displays a list of selectors:
    **Device**, **Version**, **Theme**, layout configuration, and
    Action Bar settings. The **Designer Toolbar** also includes icons for
    launching the Theme Editor and for enabling the Material Design
    Grid.

- **Toolbox** &ndash; Provides a list of widgets and layouts that you
    can drag and drop onto the **Design Surface**.

- **Properties Window** &ndash; Lists the properties of the selected
    widget for viewing and editing.

- **Document Outline** &ndash; Displays the tree of widgets that
    compose the layout. You can click an item in the tree to cause it
    to be selected on the **Design Surface**. Also, clicking an item in
    the tree loads the item's properties into the **Properties**
    window.

## Design Surface

The Designer makes it possible for you to drag and drop widgets from
the toolbox onto the **Design Surface**. When you interact with widgets
in the Designer (by either adding new widgets or repositioning existing
ones), vertical and horizontal lines are displayed to mark the
available insertion points. In the following example, a new `Button`
widget is being dragged to the **Design Surface**:

[![Example insertion lines on Design Surface](designer-basics-images/vs/05-insertion-points-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/05-insertion-points.png#lightbox)

Additionally, widgets can be copied: you can use copy and paste to copy
a widget, or you can drag and drop an existing widget while pressing the
<kbd>CTRL</kbd> key.

### Designer Toolbar

The **Designer Toolbar** (positioned above the **Design Surface**) presents
configuration selectors and tool menus:

[![Diagram of Designer Toolbar](designer-basics-images/vs/04-toolbar-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/04-toolbar.png#lightbox)

The **Designer Toolbar** provides access to the following features:

- **Alternative Layout Selector** &ndash; Allows you to select from
    different layout versions.

- **Device Selector** &ndash; Defines a set of qualifiers 
    (such as screen size, resolution, and keyboard availability)
    associated with a particular device. You can also add and 
    delete new devices.

- **Android Version Selector** &ndash; The Android version that the
    layout is targeting. The Designer will render the layout according
    to the selected Android version.

- **Theme Selector** &ndash; Selects the UI theme for the layout.

- **Configuration Selector** &ndash; Selects the device configuration,
    such as *portrait* or *landscape*.

- **Resource Qualifier Options** &ndash; Opens a dialog that
    presents drop-down menus for selecting *Language*, *UI Mode*, *Night
    Mode*, and *Round Screen* options.

- **Action Bar Settings** &ndash; Configures the Action Bar settings
    for the layout.

- **Theme Editor** &ndash; Opens the *Theme Editor*, which makes it
    possible for you to customize elements of the selected theme.

- **Material Design Grid** &ndash; Enables or disables the
    *Material Design Grid*. The drop-down menu item adjacent to
    the Material Design Grid opens a dialog that enables you
    to customize the grid.

Each of these features is explained in more detail in these topics:

- [Resource Qualifiers and Visualization Options](~/android/user-interface/android-designer/resource-qualifiers.md)
    provides detailed information about the **Device Selector**,
    **Android Version Selector**, **Theme Selector**, **Configuration
    Selector**, **Resource Qualifications Options**, and **Action Bar
    Settings**.

- [Alternative Layout Views](~/android/user-interface/android-designer/alternative-layout-views.md)
    explains how to use the **Alternative Layout Selector**.

- [Xamarin.Android Designer Material Design Features](~/android/user-interface/android-designer/material-design-features.md)
    provides a comprehensive overview of the **Theme Editor** and the
    **Material Design Grid**.

### Context menu commands

A context menu is available both in the **Design Surface** and in the
**Document Outline**. This menu displays commands that are available for
the selected widget and its container, making it easier for you to
perform operations on containers (which are not always easy to select
on the **Design Surface**). Here is an example of a context menu:

[![Example context menu when right-clicking the Design Surface](designer-basics-images/vs/06-context-menu-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/06-context-menu.png#lightbox)

In this example, right-clicking a `TextView` opens a context menu that
provides several options:

- **LinearLayout** &ndash; opens a submenu for editing the `LinearLayout`
    parent of the `TextView`.

- **Delete**, **Copy**, and **Cut** &ndash; operations that apply to the
    right-clicked `TextView`.

### Zoom controls

The **Design Surface** supports zooming via several controls as shown:

[![Diagram of the Design Surface zoom controls](designer-basics-images/vs/07-zoom-controls-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/07-zoom-controls.png#lightbox)

These controls make it easier to see certain areas of the user
interface in the Designer:

- **Highlight Containers** &ndash; Highlights containers on the
    **Design Surface** so that they are easier to locate while zooming in
    and out.

- **Normal Size** &ndash; Renders the layout pixel-for-pixel so that
    you can see how the layout will look at the resolution of the
    selected device.

- **Fit to Window** &ndash; Sets the zoom level so that the entire
    layout is visible on the Design Surface.

- **Zoom In** &ndash; Zooms in incrementally with each click,
    magnifying the layout.

- **Zoom Out** &ndash; Zooms out incrementally with each click,
    making the layout appear smaller on the Design Surface.

Note that the chosen zoom setting does not affect the user interface of
the application at runtime.

## Switching between Design and Source panes

In the center strip between the **Design** and **Source** panes,
there are several buttons that are used to modify how the **Design** and
**Source** panes are displayed:

[![Pane display button locations](designer-basics-images/vs/25-pane-buttons-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/25-pane-buttons.png#lightbox)

These buttons do the following:

- **Design** &ndash; This topmost button, **Design**, selects the
    **Design** pane. When this button is clicked, the **Toolbox** and
    **Properties** panes are enabled and the **Text Editor Toolbar** is
    not displayed. When the **Collapse** button is clicked (see below),
    the **Design** pane is presented alone without the **Source** pane.

- **Swap Panes** &ndash; This button (which resembles two opposing
    arrows) swaps the **Design** and **Source** panes so that the
    **Source** pane is on the left and the **Design** pane is on the
    right. Clicking it again swaps these panes back to their original
    locations.

- **Source** &ndash; This button (which resembles two opposing angle
    brackets) selects the **Source** pane. When this button is clicked,
    the **Toolbox** and **Properties** panes are disabled and the
    **Text Editor Toolbar** is made visible at the top of Visual
    Studio. When the **Collapse** button is clicked (see below),
    clicking the **Source** button displays the **Source** pane instead
    of the **Design** pane.

- **Vertical Split** &ndash; This button (which resembles a vertical
    bar), displays the **Design** and **Source** panes side-by-side. This is
    the default arrangement.

- **Horizontal Split** &ndash; This button (which resembles a
    horizontal bar), displays the **Design** pane above the **Source**
    pane. **Swap Panes** can be clicked to place the **Source** pane
    above the **Design** pane.

- **Collapse Pane** &ndash; This button (which resembles two
    right-pointing angle brackets) "collapses" the dual-pane display of
    **Design** and **Source** into a single view of one of these panes.
    This button becomes the **Expand Pane** button (resembling two
    left-pointing angle brackets), which can be clicked to return the
    view back to dual-pane (**Design** and **Source**) display mode.

When **Collapse Pane** is clicked, only the **Design** pane is
displayed. However, you can click the **Source** button to instead view
only the **Source** pane. Click the **Design** button again to return
to the **Design** pane.

## Source pane

The **Source** pane displays the XML source underlying the design shown
on the **Design Surface**. Because both views are available at the same
time, it is possible to create a UI design by going back and forth
between a visual representation of the design and the underlying XML
source for the design:

[![Example XML source in Source Pane](designer-basics-images/vs/22-source-pane-w158-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/22-source-pane-w158.png#lightbox)

Changes made to the XML source are immediately rendered on the **Design
Surface**; changes made on the **Design Surface** cause the XML source
displayed in the **Source** pane to be updated accordingly. When you
make changes to XML in the **Source** pane, autocompletion and
IntelliSense features are available to speed XML-based UI development
as explained next.

For greater navigational ease when working with long XML files, the
**Source** pane supports the Visual Studio scrollbar (as seen on the
right in the previous screenshot). For more information about the
scrollbar, see 
[How to Track Your Code by Customizing the Scrollbar](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn237345.aspx).

### Autocompletion

When you begin to type the name of an attribute for a widget, you can
press <kbd>CTRL+SPACE</kbd> to see a list of possible completions. For
example, after entering `android:lay` in the following example (followed
by typing <kbd>CTRL+SPACE</kbd>), the following list is presented:

[![Autocompletion of layout attribute](designer-basics-images/vs/23-autocompletion-w158-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/23-autocompletion-w158.png#lightbox)

Press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to accept the first listed completion, or use
the arrow keys to scroll to the desired completion and press
<kbd>ENTER</kbd>. Alternatively, you can use the mouse to scroll to and
click the desired completion.

### IntelliSense

After you enter a new attribute for a widget and begin to assign it a
value, IntelliSense pops up after a trigger character is typed and
provides a list of valid values to use for that attribute. For example,
after the first double-quote is entered for `android:layout_width` in
the following example, an autocompletion selector pops up to provide
the list of valid choices for this width:

[![IntelliSense example for layout width](designer-basics-images/vs/24-intellisense-w158-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/24-intellisense-w158.png#lightbox)

At the bottom of this popup are two buttons (as outlined in red in the
above screenshot). Clicking the **Project Resources** button on the
left restricts the list to resources that are part of the app project,
while clicking the **Framework Resources** button on the right
restricts the list to display resources available from the framework.
These buttons toggle on or off: you can click them again to disable the
filtering action that each provides.

## Properties pane

The Designer supports the editing of widget properties through the
**Properties** pane: 

![Screenshot of the Properties window](designer-basics-images/vs/08-property-pad.png)

The properties listed in the **Properties** pane
change depending on which widget is selected on the **Design Surface**.

### Default values

The properties of most widgets will be blank in the **Properties**
window because their values inherit from the selected Android theme.
The **Properties** window will only show values that are explicitly set
for the selected widget; it will not show values that are inherited
from the theme.

### Referencing resources

Some properties can reference resources that are defined in files other
than the layout **.axml** file. The most common cases of this type are
`string` and `drawable` resources. However, references can also be used
for other resources, such as `Boolean` values and dimensions. When a
property supports resource references, a browse icon (a square) is
shown next to the text entry for the property. This button opens a
resource selector when clicked.

For example, the following screenshot shows the options available
when clicking the darkened square to the right of the text field for a
`Text` widget in the **Properties** window:

[![Example list of text options](designer-basics-images/vs/09-text-options-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/09-text-options.png#lightbox)

When **Resource...** is clicked, the **Select Resource** dialog is presented:

[![Example Resources screenshot with several resources listed](designer-basics-images/vs/09b-resources-w158-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/09b-resources-w158.png#lightbox)

From this list, you can select a text resource to use for that widget
instead of hard-coding the text in the **Properties** pane. The next
example illustrates the resource selector for the `Src` property of an
`ImageView`:

[![Resource selector listing icon resource for an ImageView](designer-basics-images/vs/10-src-resource-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/vs/10-src-resource.png#lightbox)

Clicking the blank square to the right of the `Src` property opens the
**Select Resource** dialog with a list of resources ranging from colors
(as shown above) to drawables.

### Boolean property references

*Boolean* properties are normally selected as check marks next to a
property in the Properties window. You can designate a `true` or
`false` value by checking or unchecking this check box, or you can
select a property reference by clicking the dark-filled square to the
right of the property. In the following example, text is changed to all
caps by clicking the **Text All Caps** boolean property reference
associated with the selected `TextView`:

![Example of setting boolean properties](designer-basics-images/vs/11-boolean.png)

## Editing properties inline

The Android Designer supports direct editing of certain properties on
the **Design Surface** (so you don't have to search for these
properties in the property list). Properties that can be directly
edited include text, margin, and size.

### Text

The text properties of some widgets (such as `Button` and `TextView`),
can be edited directly on the **Design Surface**. Double-clicking a
widget will put it into edit mode, as shown below:

![Text resource for the hello string](designer-basics-images/vs/12-text-resource.png "Text Resource")

You can enter a new text value or you can enter a new resource
string. In the following example, the `@string/hello` resource is being
replaced with the text, `CLICK THIS BUTTON`:

![Shift + Enter to automatically link text to a new resource](designer-basics-images/vs/13-shift-enter-resource.png)

This change is stored in the widget's `text` property; it does not
modify the value assigned to the `@string/hello` resource.
When you key in a new text string, you can press <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
<kbd>Enter</kbd> to automatically link the entered text to a new
resource.

### Margin

When you select a widget, the Designer displays handles that allow you
to change the size or margin of the widget interactively. Clicking the
widget while it is selected toggles between margin-editing mode and
size-editing mode.

When you click a widget for the first time, margin handles are
displayed. If you move the mouse to one of the handles, the Designer
displays the property that the handle will change (as shown
below for the `layout_marginLeft` property):

![Screenshot showing margin handles in the Designer](designer-basics-images/vs/15-margin-handles.png)

If a margin has already been set, dotted lines are displayed,
indicating the space that the margin occupies:

![Example of dotted lines marking space around a button](designer-basics-images/vs/16-margins-set.png)

### Size

As mentioned earlier, you can switch to size-editing mode by clicking a
widget while it is already selected. Click the triangular handle to
set the size for the indicated dimension to `wrap_content`:

![Wrap Content and Resize handles](designer-basics-images/vs/17-wrap-content.png)

Clicking the **Wrap Content** handle shrinks the widget in that dimension
so that it is no larger than necessary to wrap the enclosed content. In
this example, the button text shrinks horizontally as shown in the next
screenshot.

When the size value is set to **Wrap Content**, the Designer displays a
triangular handle pointing in the opposite direction for changing the
size to `match_parent`:

![Match parent handle](designer-basics-images/vs/18-match-parent.png)

Clicking the **Match Parent** handle restores the size in that
dimension so that it is the same as the parent widget.

Also, you can drag the circular resize handle (as shown in the above
screenshots) to resize the widget to an arbitrary `dp` value. When you
do so, both **Wrap Content** and **Match Parent** handles are presented
for that dimension:

![Circular resize handles](designer-basics-images/vs/19-resize-dp.png)

Not all containers allow editing the `Size` of a widget. For example,
notice that in the screenshot below with the `LinearLayout` selected,
the resize handles do not appear:

![No resize handles](designer-basics-images/vs/20-no-resize-handles.png)

## Document Outline

The **Document Outline** displays the widget hierarchy of the layout.
In the following example, the containing `LinearLayout` widget is
selected:

![Document Outline example](designer-basics-images/vs/21-document-outline.png)

The outline of the selected widget (in this case, a `LinearLayout`) is
also highlighted on the **Design Surface**. The selected widget in the
Document Outline stays in sync with its counterpart on the **Design
Surface**. This is useful for selecting view groups, which are not always
easy to select on the **Design Surface**.

The **Document Outline** supports copy and paste, or you can use drag
and drop. Drag and drop is supported from the **Document Outline** to
the **Design Surface** as well as from the **Design Surface** to the
**Document Outline**. Also, right-clicking an item in the **Document
Outline** displays the context menu for that item (the same context
menu that appears when you right-click that same widget on the **Design
Surface**).

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/macos)

## Launching the Designer

The Designer is launched automatically when a layout is created, or it
can be launched by double-clicking an existing .axml file. For example,
double-clicking **Main.axml** in the **Resources > Layout** folder will
load the Designer as shown below:

[![Designer screen in Visual Studio for Mac](designer-basics-images/xs/01-open-designer-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/01-open-designer.png#lightbox)

Likewise, you can add a new layout by right-clicking the **layout**
folder in the **Solution Pad** and selecting **Add > New File > Android > Layout**:

[![Add New File dialog](designer-basics-images/xs/02-add-new-layout-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/02-add-new-layout.png#lightbox)

This creates a new .axml file and loads it onto the Design Surface.

> [!TIP]
> Newer releases of Visual Studio support opening .xml files inside the Android Designer.
>
> Both .axml and .xml files are supported in the Android Designer.

## Designer features

The Designer is composed of several sections that support its various
features, as shown in the following screenshot:

[![Diagram of Designer panes](designer-basics-images/xs/03-designer-features-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/03-designer-features.png#lightbox)

When you edit a layout in the Designer, you use the following features
to create and shape your design:

- **Design Surface** &ndash; Facilitates the visual construction of
    the user interface by giving you an editable representation of how
    the layout will appear on the device.

- **Toolbar** &ndash; Displays a list of selectors: **Device**,
    **Version**, **Theme**, layout configuration, and Action Bar
    settings. The Toolbar also includes icons for launching the Theme
    Editor and for enabling the Material Design Grid.

- **Toolbox** &ndash; Provides a list of widgets and layouts that you
    can drag and drop onto the Design Surface.

- **Property Pad** &ndash; Lists the properties of the selected
    widget for viewing and editing.

- **Document Outline** &ndash; Displays the tree of widgets that
    compose the layout. You can click an item in the tree to cause it
    to be selected in the Designer. Also, clicking an item in the tree
    loads the item's properties into the Property Pad.

## Toolbar

The Toolbar (positioned above the Design Surface) presents
configuration selectors and tool menus:

[![Diagram of Designer Toolbar](designer-basics-images/xs/04-toolbar-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/04-toolbar.png#lightbox)

The Toolbar provides access to the following features:

- **Alternative Layout Selector** &ndash; Allows you to select from
    different layout versions.

- **Device Selector** &ndash; Defines a set of qualifiers associated
    with a particular device such as screen size, resolution, and
    keyboard availability. You can also add and delete new devices.

- **Android Version Selector** &ndash; The Android version that the
    layout is targeting. The Designer will render the layout according
    to the selected Android version.

- **Theme Selector** &ndash; Selects the UI theme for the layout.

- **Configuration Selector** &ndash; Selects the device configuration,
    such as *portrait* or *landscape*.

- **Resource Qualifier Options** &ndash; Opens a dialog that
    presents drop-down menus for selecting *Language*, *UI Mode*, *Night
    Mode*, and *Round Screen* options.

- **Action Bar Settings** &ndash; Configures the Action Bar settings
    for the layout.

- **Theme Editor** &ndash; Opens the *Theme Editor*, which makes it
    possible for you to customize elements of the selected theme.

- **Material Design Grid** &ndash; Enables or disables the
    *Material Design Grid*. The drop-down menu item adjacent to
    the Material Design Grid opens a dialog that enables you
    to customize the grid.

Each of these features is explained in more detail in these topics:

[Resource Qualifiers and Visualization Options](~/android/user-interface/android-designer/resource-qualifiers.md)
provides detailed information about the **Device Selector**, **Android
Version Selector**, **Theme Selector**, **Configuration Selector**, **Resource
Qualifications Options**, and **Action Bar Settings**.

[Alternative Layout Views](~/android/user-interface/android-designer/alternative-layout-views.md)
explains how to use the **Alternative Layout Selector**.

[Material Design Features](~/android/user-interface/android-designer/material-design-features.md)
provides a comprehensive overview of the **Theme Editor** and the **Material Design Grid**.

## Design Surface

The Designer makes it possible for you to drag and drop widgets from
the toolbox onto the Design Surface. When you interact with widgets in
the Designer (by either adding new widgets or repositioning existing
ones), vertical and horizontal lines are displayed to mark the
available insertion points. In the following example, a new `Button`
widget is being dragged to the Design Surface:

[![Example insertion lines on Design Surface](designer-basics-images/xs/05-insertion-points-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/05-insertion-points.png#lightbox)

Additionally, widgets can be copied: you can use copy and paste to copy
a widget, or you can drag and drop an existing widget while pressing the
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key.

### Context menu commands

A context menu is available both in the Design Surface and in the
Document Outline. This menu displays commands that are available for
the selected widget and its container, making it easier for you
to perform operations on containers (which are not always easy to
select on the Design Surface). Here is an example of a context menu:

[![Example context menu when right-clicking the Design Surface](designer-basics-images/xs/06-context-menu-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/06-context-menu.png#lightbox)

In this example, right-clicking a `Button` opens a context menu that
provides several options:

- **LinearLayout** &ndash; opens a submenu for editing the `LinearLayout`
    parent of the `Button`.

- **Cut**, **Copy**, and **Delete** &ndash; operations that apply to the
    right-clicked `Button`.

### Zoom controls

The Design Surface supports zooming via several controls as shown:

[![Diagram of the Design Surface zoom controls](designer-basics-images/xs/07-zoom-controls-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/07-zoom-controls.png#lightbox)

These controls make it easier to see certain areas of the user
interface in the Designer:

- **Highlight Containers** &ndash; Highlights containers on the
    Design Surface so that they are easier to locate while zooming in
    and out.

- **Normal Size** &ndash; Renders the layout pixel-for-pixel so that
    you can see how the layout will look at the resolution of the
    selected device.

- **Fit to Window** &ndash; Sets the zoom level so that the entire
    layout is visible on the Design Surface.

- **Zoom In** &ndash; Zooms in incrementally with each click,
    magnifying the layout.

- **Zoom Out** &ndash; Zooms out incrementally with each click,
    making the layout appear smaller on the Design Surface.

Note that the chosen zoom setting does not affect the user interface of
the application at runtime.

## Property Pad

The Designer supports the editing of widget properties through the
**Property Pad**. The properties listed in the Property Pad change
depending on which widget is selected in the Designer surface. When the
`Button` in the previous example is selected, the properties for that
`Button` widget are shown:

[![Screenshot of the Property pad](designer-basics-images/xs/08-property-pad-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/08-property-pad.png#lightbox)

## Property Pad sections

The Property Pad is divided into several sections that group similar
properties together &ndash; this makes it easier to locate properties
of interest:

- **Widget** &ndash; Main properties of the widget, such as `id`,
    `visibility`, `text`, etc. Properties for managing the widget's
    content are usually placed here.

- **Style** &ndash; Properties that change the visual appearance of
    the widget, such as `font`, `text color`, `background`, etc.

- **Layout** &ndash; Properties that set the location and size of the
    widget.

- **Scroll** &ndash; Scrolling properties.

- **Behavior** &ndash; Flags that set how the widget behaves.

### Default values

The properties of most widgets will be blank in the **Property Pad**
because their values inherit from the selected Android theme. The
**Property Pad** will only show values that are explicitly set for the
selected widget; it will not show values that are inherited from the
theme.

### Referencing resources

Some properties can reference resources that are defined in files other
than the layout **.axml** file. The most common cases of this type are
`string` and `drawable` resources. However, references can also be
used for other resources, such as `Boolean` values and dimensions.
When a property supports resource references, a browse icon (an
ellipsis, &hellip;) is shown next to the text entry for the property.
When clicked, this button opens a resource selector.

For example, the following screenshot shows the resources available
when clicking the ellipsis to the right of the text field for a
`Button` widget in the **Property Pad**:

[![Example Resources screenshot with two resources listed](designer-basics-images/xs/09-resources-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/09-resources.png#lightbox)

The next example illustrates the resource selector for the `Src`
property of an `ImageView`:

[![Resource selector listing icon resource for an ImageView](designer-basics-images/xs/10-src-resource-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/10-src-resource.png#lightbox)

### Boolean property references

*Boolean* properties are normally shown as a check box in the Property
Pad. When a `Boolean` property supports resource references, a small
check box appears next to the property. A checked checkbox means `true`
and an empty box means `false`. You can also directly enter a value
such as `true` or `false`. Hovering your mouse over the input brings up
a small text field icon. You can click on it if you wish to enter the
value manually.

## Grouped properties

Some widgets have multi-value properties that are grouped together
(such as `Padding`, for example). These property values are listed in
the **Property Pad** in a single, expandable row. Some of these
properties can be edited directly in the grouped row, such as the
`Padding` property shown below:

[![Example settings for the Padding property](designer-basics-images/xs/13-padding-property-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/13-padding-property.png#lightbox)

## Editing properties inline

The Android Designer supports direct editing of certain properties on
the Design Surface (so you don't have to search for these properties in
the property list). Properties that can be directly edited include
text, margin, and size.

### Text

The text properties of some widgets (such as `Button` and `TextView`),
can be edited directly on the Design Surface. Double-clicking a
widget will put it into edit mode, as shown below:

[![Text resource for the hello string](designer-basics-images/xs/14-text-resource-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/14-text-resource.png#lightbox)

You can enter a new text value or you can enter a new resource
string. In the following example, the `@string/hello` resource is being
replaced with the text, `CLICK THIS BUTTON`:

[![Shift + Enter to automatically link text to a new resource](designer-basics-images/xs/15-shift-enter-resource-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/15-shift-enter-resource.png#lightbox)

This change is stored in the widget's `text` property; it does not
modify the value assigned to the `@string/hello` resource.
When you key in a new text string, you can press <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
<kbd>Enter</kbd> to automatically link the entered text to a new
resource.

### Margin

When you select a widget, the Designer displays handles that allow you
to change the size or margin of the widget interactively. Clicking the
widget while it is selected toggles between margin-editing mode and
size-editing mode.

When you click a widget for the first time, margin handles are
displayed. If you move the mouse to one of the handles, the Designer
displays the property that the handle will change (as shown
below for the `layout_marginLeft` property):

[![Screenshot showing margin handles in the Designer](designer-basics-images/xs/16-margin-handles-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/16-margin-handles.png#lightbox)

If a margin has already been set, dotted lines are displayed,
indicating the space that the margin occupies:

[![Example of dotted lines marking space around a button](designer-basics-images/xs/17-margins-set-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/17-margins-set.png#lightbox)

### Size

As mentioned earlier, you can switch to size-editing mode by clicking a
widget while it is already selected. Click the triangular handle to
set the size for the indicated dimension to `wrap_content`:

[![Wrap Content and Resize handles](designer-basics-images/xs/18-wrap-content-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/18-wrap-content.png#lightbox)

Clicking the **Wrap Content** handle shrinks the widget in that dimension
so that is no larger than necessary to wrap the enclosed content. In
this example, the button text shrinks horizontally as shown in the next
screenshot.

When the size value is set to **Wrap Content**, the Designer displays a
triangular handle pointing in the opposite direction for changing the
size to `match_parent`:

[![Match parent handle](designer-basics-images/xs/19-match-parent-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/19-match-parent.png#lightbox)

Clicking the **Match Parent** handle restores the size in that
dimension so that it is the same as the parent widget.

Also, you can drag the circular resize handle (as shown in the above
screenshots) to resize the widget to an arbitrary `dp` value. When you
do so, both **Wrap Content** and **Match Parent** handles are presented
for that dimension:

[![Circular resize handles](designer-basics-images/xs/20-resize-dp-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/20-resize-dp.png#lightbox)

Not all containers allow editing the `Size` of a widget. For example,
notice that in the screenshot below with the `LinearLayout` selected,
the resize handles do not appear:

[![No resize handles](designer-basics-images/xs/21-no-resize-handles-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/20-no-resize-handles.png#lightbox)

## Document Outline

The **Document Outline** displays the widget hierarchy of the layout.
In the following example, the containing `LinearLayout` widget is
selected:

[![Document outline](designer-basics-images/xs/22-outline-view-sml.png)](designer-basics-images/xs/22-outline-view.png#lightbox)

The outline of the selected widget (in this case, a `LinearLayout`) is
also highlighted on the Design Surface. The selected widget in the
Document Outline stays in sync with its counterpart on the Design
Surface. This is useful for selecting view groups, which are not always
easy to select on the Design Surface.

The Document Outline supports copy and paste, or you can use drag and
drop. Drag and drop is supported from the Document Outline to the
Design Surface as well as from the Design Surface to the Document
Outline. Also, right-clicking an item in the Document Outline displays
the context menu for that item (the same context menu that appears when
you right-click that same widget on the Design Surface).

# Tabbed Layouts

## Overview

Tabs are a popular user interface pattern in mobile applications 
because of their simplicity and usability. They provide a consistent, 
easy way to navigate between various screens in an application. Android 
has several API's for tabbed interfaces: 

- **ActionBar** &ndash; This is part of a new set of API's that was 
    introduced in Android 3.0 (API level 11) with goal of providing a 
    consistent navigation and view-switching interface. It has been 
    back ported to Android 2.2 (API level 8) with the 
    [Android Support Library v7](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Android.Support.v7.AppCompat/). 

- **PagerTabStrip** &ndash; Indicates the current, next, and previous pages 
    of a `ViewPager`. `ViewPager` is available only via 
    [Android Support Library v4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Android.Support.v4/).
     For more information about `PagerTabStrip`, see 
    [ViewPager](~/android/user-interface/controls/view-pager/index.md).

- **Toolbar** &ndash; `Toolbar` is a newer and more flexible action 
    bar component that replaces `ActionBar`. `Toolbar` is available in
    Android 5.0 Lollipop or later, and it is also available for older versions of Android via the 
    [Android Support Library v7](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Android.Support.v7.AppCompat/) NuGet package. 
    `Toolbar` is currently the recommended action bar component to use in Android apps.
    For more information, see [Toolbar](~/android/user-interface/controls/tool-bar/index.md).

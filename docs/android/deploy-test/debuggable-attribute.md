# Debuggable Attribute



To make debugging possible, Android supports the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP). This is a technology that allows tools such as ADB to communicate with a JVM. While JDWP is important during development, it should be disabled prior to the applicaiton being published.

JDWP can be the value of the `android:debuggable` attribute in an Android application. Xamarin.Android provides the following ways to set this attribute:

1. Created a  `AndroidManifext.xml` file, and setting the  `android:debuggable` attribute there.
2. Including the  `ApplicationAttribute` in a  `.CS` file like so :  `[assembly: Application(Debuggable=false)]` .


If both the `AndroidManifest.xml` and the `ApplicationAttribute` are present, the contents of `AndroidManifest.xml` take priority over what is specified by the `ApplicationAttribute`.

If neither the `AndroidManifest.xml` nor the `ApplicationAttribute` is present, then the default value of the `android:debuggable` attribute depends on whether or not debug symbols are generated. If debug symbols are present, then Xamarin.Android will set the `android:debuggable` attribute to `true`.

Note that the value of the `android:debuggable` attribute does NOT necessarily depend on the build configuration. It is possible for release builds to have the `android:debuggable` attribute set to true.

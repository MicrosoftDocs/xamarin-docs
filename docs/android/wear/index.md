# Android Wear

Android Wear is a version of Android that is designed for wearable
devices such as smart watches. This section includes instructions on
how to install and configure tools required for Wear development, a
step-by-step walkthrough for creating your first Wear device, and a
list of samples that you can refer to for creating your own Wear apps.

## [Getting Started](~/android/wear/get-started/index.md)

Introduces Android Wear, describes how to install and configure your
computer for Wear development, and provides steps to help you create
and run your first Android Wear app on an emulator or Wear device.

## [User Interface](~/android/wear/user-interface/index.md)

Explains Android Wear-specific controls and provides links to
samples that demonstrate how to use these controls.

## [Platform Features](~/android/wear/platform/index.md)

Documents in this section cover features specific to Android Wear. Here
you'll find a topic that describes how to create a WatchFace.

## [Screen Sizes](~/android/wear/screen-sizes.md)

Preview and optimize your user interface for the available screen sizes.

## [Deployment & Testing](~/android/wear/deploy-test/index.md)

Explains how to deploy your Android Wear app to an Android
Wear device or to Android emulator configured for Wear. It also
includes debugging tips and information for how to set up a Bluetooth
connection between your development computer and an Android device.

## [Wear APIs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/wearable)

The Android Developer site provides detailed information about key Wear APIs
such as [Wearable Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/wearable/activity/package-summary.html),
[Intents](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/wearable/intent/package-summary.html),
[Authentication](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/wearable/authentication/package-summary.html),
[Complications](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/wearable/complications/package-summary.html),
[Complications Rendering](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/wearable/complications/rendering/package-summary.html),
[Notifications](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/wearable/notifications/package-summary.html),
[Views](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/wearable/view/package-summary.html), and
[WatchFace](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/wearable/watchface/package-summary.html).

## Samples

You can find a number of
[samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?products=xamarin&term=Xamarin.Android+wear) using Android Wear (or go
directly to
[github](https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/tree/master/wear)).

|Sample|Description|Screenshot|
|--- |--- |--- |
|[SkeletonWear](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/monodroid-samples/wear-skeletonwear)|A simple example of the basics of wearable projects, including GridViewPager and interactive notifications.|![Screenshot of Skeletonwear](images/skeleton.png)|
|[WatchViewStub](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/monodroid-samples/wear-watchviewstub)|A simple demo of the WatchViewStub control that detects screen shape and automatically loads the correct layout. See how WatchViewStub works in the **Resources/layout/main_activity.xml** layout.|![Screenshot of WatchViewStub](images/watchview.png)|
|[RecipeAssistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/monodroid-samples/wear-recipeassistant)|Demonstration of Wear notification pages, in the form of recipe steps. Notifications are created in RecipeService.cs.|![Screenshot of RecipeAssistant](images/recipeassist.png)|
|[ElizaChat](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/monodroid-samples/wear-elizachat)|Fun sample of interacting with a "personal assistant" called Eliza, using Wear interactive notifications to create a conversation using canned responses.|![Screenshot of ElizaChat](images/eliza.png)|
|[GridViewPager](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/monodroid-samples/wear-gridviewpager)|GridViewPager implements the 2D navigation pattern, where the user swipes vertically and then horizontally to navigate through options and content.|![Screenshot of GridViewPager](images/gridviewpager.png)|
|[WatchFace](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/monodroid-samples/wear-watchface)|WatchFace is a custom watch face with analog-style hour, minute, and second hands. This sample demonstrates how to create a watch face service that draws the current time and handles ambient mode and visibility change events. It includes a broadcast receiver that listens for time zone changes and automatically updates the time accordingly.|![Screenshot of WatchFace](images/gridviewpager.png)|

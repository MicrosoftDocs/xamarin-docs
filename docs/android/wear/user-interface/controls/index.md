# Android Wear Controls

Android Wear apps can use many of the same controls already in use for
regular Android apps, including `Button`, `TextView`, and image
drawables. Layout controls including `ScrollView`, `LinearLayout`, and
`RelativateLayout` can also be used.

This page links to the Android-Wear-specific controls from the 
[wearable UI library](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/layouts.html#UiLibrary) 
available in Xamarin projects via the 
[Wearable Support](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Android.Wear/) 
NuGet package. These controls include the following:

-   **GridViewPager** &ndash; Create a two-dimensional navigation
    interface where the user scrolls down then across to make a
    selection (for more information, see
    [GridViewPager](~/android/wear/user-interface/controls/gridviewpager.md)):

Other important controls for Wear apps include:

* `BoxInsetLayout` (see [working with screen sizes](~/android/wear/screen-sizes.md)),

* `WatchViewStub` (see [working with screen sizes](~/android/wear/screen-sizes.md)),

* `CardFrame` (see [Android Creating Cards](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/ui/cards.html)),

* `CardScrollView` (see [Android Creating Cards](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/ui/cards.html)),

* `WearableListView` (see [Android Create Lists](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/ui/lists.html)).

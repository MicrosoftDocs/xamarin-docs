# Managing Virtual Devices with the Android Device Manager

_This article explains how to use the Android Device Manager to create
and configure Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) that emulate physical Android
devices. You can use these virtual devices to run and test your app
without having to rely on a physical device._

After you have verified that hardware acceleration is enabled (as
described in
[Hardware Acceleration for Emulator Performance](~/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator/hardware-acceleration.md)),
the next step is to use the _Android Device Manager_ (also referred to
as the _Xamarin Android Device Manager_) to create virtual devices that
you can use to test and debug your app.

## Android Device Manager on Windows

This article explains how to use the Android Device Manager to create,
duplicate, customize, and launch Android virtual devices.

[![Screenshot of the Android Device Manager in the Devices tab](device-manager-images/win/01-devices-dialog-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/01-devices-dialog.png#lightbox)

You use the Android Device Manager to create and configure _Android
Virtual Devices_ (AVDs) that run in the
[Android Emulator](~/android/deploy-test/debugging/debug-on-emulator.md).
Each AVD is an emulator configuration that simulates a physical Android
device. This makes it possible to run and test your app in a variety of
configurations that simulate different physical Android devices.

## Requirements

To use the Android Device Manager, you will need the following items:

- Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 or later is required. Visual Studio
  Community, Professional, and Enterprise editions are supported.

- Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin version 4.9 or later.

- The Android SDK must be installed (see
  [Setting up the Android SDK for Xamarin.Android](~/android/get-started/installation/android-sdk.md)).
  Be sure to install the Android SDK at its default location if it
  is not already installed: **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk**.

- The following packages must be installed (via the
  [Android SDK Manager](~/android/get-started/installation/android-sdk.md)): 
    - **Android SDK Tools version 26.1.1** or later
    - **Android SDK Platform-Tools 27.0.1** or later
    - **Android SDK Build-Tools 27.0.3** or later 
    - **Android Emulator 27.2.7** or later. 

  These packages should be displayed with **Installed** status as seen in
  the following screenshot:

  [![Installing Android SDK Tools](device-manager-images/win/02-sdk-tools-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/02-sdk-tools.png#lightbox)


## Launching the Device Manager

Launch the Android Device Manager from the **Tools** menu by
clicking **Tools > Android > Android Device Manager**:

[![Launching the Device manager from the Tools menu](device-manager-images/win/03-tools-menu-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/03-tools-menu.png#lightbox)

If the following error dialog is presented on launch, see the
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for workaround
instructions:

![Android SDK instance error dialog](device-manager-images/win/04-sdk-error.png)


## Main Screen

When you first launch the Android Device Manager, it presents a screen
that displays all currently-configured virtual devices. For each
virtual device, the **Name**, **OS** (Android Version), **Processor**,
**Memory** size, and screen **Resolution** are displayed:

[![List of installed devices and their parameters](device-manager-images/win/05-installed-list-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/05-installed-list.png#lightbox)

When you select a device in the list, the **Start** button appears on
the right. You can click the **Start** button to launch the emulator
with this virtual device:

[![Start button for a device image](device-manager-images/win/06-start-button-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/06-start-button.png#lightbox)

After the emulator starts with the selected virtual device, the
**Start** button changes to a **Stop** button that you can use to halt
the emulator:

[![Stop button for the running device](device-manager-images/win/07-stop-button-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/07-stop-button.png#lightbox)

### New Device

To create a new device, click the **New** button (located in the upper
right-hand area of the screen):

[![New button for creating a new device](device-manager-images/win/08-new-button-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/08-new-button.png#lightbox)

Clicking **New** launches the **New Device** screen:

[![New Device screen of the Device Manager](device-manager-images/win/09-new-device-editor-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/09-new-device-editor.png#lightbox)

To configure a new device in the **New Device** screen, use the
following steps:

1. Give the device a new name. In the following example, the new device
   is named **Pixel_API_27**:

   [![Naming the new device](device-manager-images/win/10-device-name-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/10-device-name.png#lightbox)

2. Select a physical device to emulate by clicking the **Base Device**
   pull-down menu:

   [![Selecting the physical device to emulate](device-manager-images/win/11-device-menu-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/11-device-menu.png#lightbox)

3. Select a processor type for this virtual device by clicking the
   **Processor** pull-down menu. Selecting **x86** will provide the
   best performance because it enables the emulator to take advantage
   of [hardware acceleration](~/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator/hardware-acceleration.md).
   The **x86_64** option will also make use of hardware acceleration,
   but it runs slightly slower than **x86** (**x86_64** is normally
   used for testing 64-bit apps):

   [![Selecting the processor type](device-manager-images/win/12-processor-type-menu-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/12-processor-type-menu.png#lightbox)

4. Select the Android version (API level) by clicking the **OS**
   pull-down menu. For example, select **Oreo 8.1 - API 27** to create
   a virtual device for API level 27:

   [![Selecting the Android version](device-manager-images/win/13-android-version-w158-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/13-android-version-w158.png#lightbox)

   If you select an Android API level that has not yet been installed, the
   Device Manager will display **A new device will be downloaded**
   message at the bottom of the screen &ndash; it will download and
   install the necessary files as it creates the new virtual device:

   ![A new device image will be downloaded](device-manager-images/win/14-automatic-download-w158.png)

5. If you want to include Google Play Services APIs in your virtual
   device, enable the **Google APIs** option. To include the Google
   Play Store app, enable the **Google Play Store** option:

   [![Selecting Google Play Services and Google Play Store](device-manager-images/win/15-google-play-services-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/15-google-play-services.png#lightbox)

   Note that Google Play Store images are available only for some base
   device types such as Pixel, Pixel 2, Nexus 5, and Nexus 5X.

6. Edit any properties that you need to modify. To make changes to
   properties, see
   [Editing Android Virtual Device Properties](~/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator/device-properties.md).

7. Add any additional properties that you need to explicitly set. The
   **New Device** screen lists only the most commonly-modified
   properties, but you can click the **Add Property** pull-down menu
   (at the bottom) to add additional properties:

   [![Add Property pull-down menu](device-manager-images/win/16-add-property-menu-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/16-add-property-menu.png#lightbox)

    You can also define a custom property by selecting **Custom...** at
    the top of the property list.

8. Click the **Create** button (lower right-hand corner) to create the
   new device:

   [![Create button](device-manager-images/win/17-create-button-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/17-create-button.png#lightbox)

9. You might get a **License Acceptance** screen. Click **Accept** if
   you agree to the license terms:

   [![License Acceptance screen](device-manager-images/win/18-license-acceptance-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/18-license-acceptance.png#lightbox)

10. The Android Device Manager adds the new device to the list of
    installed virtual devices while displaying a **Creating** progress
    indicator during device creation:

    [![Creation progress Indicator](device-manager-images/win/19-creating-the-device-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/19-creating-the-device.png#lightbox)

11. When the creation process is complete, the new device is shown in
    the list of installed virtual devices with a **Start** button,
    ready to launch:

    [![Newly-created device ready to launch](device-manager-images/win/20-created-device-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/20-created-device.png#lightbox)


### Edit Device

To edit an existing virtual device, select the device and click the
**Edit** button (located in the upper right-hand corner of the screen):

[![Edit button for modifying a device](device-manager-images/win/21-edit-button-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/21-edit-button.png#lightbox)

Clicking **Edit** launches the Device Editor for the selected virtual device:

[![Device Editor screen](device-manager-images/win/22-device-editor-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/22-device-editor.png#lightbox)

The **Device Editor** screen lists the properties of the virtual device
under the **Property** column, with the corresponding values of each property in
the **Value** column. When you select a property, a detailed description
of that property is displayed on the right.

To change a property, edit its value in the **Value** column.
For example, in the following screenshot the `hw.lcd.density` property
is being changed from **480** to **240**:

[![Device Editing example](device-manager-images/win/23-device-editing-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/23-device-editing.png#lightbox)

After you have made the necessary configuration changes, click the **Save** button.
For more information about changing virtual device properties, see
[Editing Android Virtual Device Properties](~/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator/device-properties.md).


### Additional Options

Additional options for working with devices are available from the
**Additional Options** (&hellip;) pull-down menu in the upper
right-hand corner:

[![Location of additional options menu](device-manager-images/win/24-overflow-menu-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/24-overflow-menu.png#lightbox)

The additional options menu contains the following items:

- **Duplicate and Edit** &ndash; Duplicates the currently-selected
  device and opens it in the **New Device** screen with a different
  unique name. For example, selecting **Pixel_API_27** and clicking
  **Duplicate and Edit** appends a counter to the name:

  [![Duplicate and Edit screen](device-manager-images/win/25-dupe-and-edit-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/25-dupe-and-edit.png#lightbox)

- **Reveal in Explorer** &ndash; Opens a Windows Explorer window in the
  folder that holds the files for the virtual device. For example,
  selecting **Pixel_API_27** and clicking **Reveal in Explorer** opens
  a window like the following example:

  [![Results of clicking Reveal in Explorer](device-manager-images/win/26-reveal-in-explorer-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/26-reveal-in-explorer.png#lightbox)

- **Factory Reset** &ndash; Resets the selected device to its default
  settings, erasing any user changes made to the internal state of the
  device while it was running (this also erases the current
  [Quick Boot](~/android/deploy-test/debugging/debug-on-emulator.md#quick-boot)
  snapshot, if any). This change does not alter modifications that you
  make to the virtual device during creation and editing. A dialog box
  will appear with the reminder that this reset cannot be undone. Click
  **Factory Reset** to confirm the reset:

  ![Factory Reset dialog](device-manager-images/win/27-factory-reset.png)

- **Delete** &ndash; Permanently deletes the selected virtual device. A

## Android Device Manager on macOS

This article explains how to use the Android Device Manager to create,
duplicate, customize, and launch Android virtual devices.

[![Screenshot of the Android Device Manager in the Devices tab](device-manager-images/mac/01-devices-dialog-sml.png)](device-manager-images/mac/01-devices-dialog.png#lightbox)

> [!NOTE]
> This guide applies only to Visual Studio for Mac.
Xamarin Studio is incompatible with the Android Device Manager.

You use the Android Device Manager to create and configure *Android
Virtual Devices* (AVDs) that run in the
[Android Emulator](~/android/deploy-test/debugging/debug-on-emulator.md).
Each AVD is an emulator configuration that simulates a physical Android
device. This makes it possible to run and test your app in a variety of
configurations that simulate different physical Android devices.

## Requirements

To use the Android Device Manager, you will need the following items:

- Visual Studio for Mac 7.6 or later.

- The Android SDK must be installed (see
  [Setting up the Android SDK for Xamarin.Android](~/android/get-started/installation/android-sdk.md)).

- The following packages must be installed (via the
  [Android SDK Manager](~/android/get-started/installation/android-sdk.md)): 
    -  **SDK tools version 26.1.1** or later
    -  **Android SDK Platform-Tools 28.0.1** or later 
    -  **Android SDK Build-Tools 26.0.3** or later

  These packages should be displayed with **Installed** status as seen in
  the following screenshot:

  [![Installing Android SDK Tools](device-manager-images/mac/02-sdk-tools-sml.png)](device-manager-images/mac/02-sdk-tools.png#lightbox)

[![Launching the Device manager from the Tools menu](device-manager-images/mac/03-tools-menu-sml.png)](device-manager-images/mac/03-tools-menu.png#lightbox)

If the following error dialog is presented on launch, see the
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for workaround
instructions:

![Android SDK instance error dialog](device-manager-images/mac/04-sdk-instance-error.png)


## Main Screen

When you first launch the Android Device Manager, it presents a screen
that displays all currently-configured virtual devices. For each
virtual device, the **Name**, **OS** (Android Version), **Processor**,
**Memory** size, and screen **Resolution** are displayed:

[![List of installed devices and their parameters](device-manager-images/mac/05-devices-list-sml.png)](device-manager-images/mac/05-devices-list.png#lightbox)

When you select a device in the list, the **Play** button appears on
the right. You can click the **Play** button to launch the emulator
with this virtual device:

[![Play button for a device image](device-manager-images/mac/06-start-button-sml.png)](device-manager-images/mac/06-start-button.png#lightbox)

After the emulator starts with the selected virtual device, the
**Play** button changes to a **Stop** button that you can use to halt
the emulator:

[![Stop button for the running device](device-manager-images/mac/07-stop-button-sml.png)](device-manager-images/mac/07-stop-button.png#lightbox)

When you stop the emulator, you may get a prompt asking if you want to save
the current state for the next quick boot:

![Save current state for Quick Boot dialog](device-manager-images/mac/08-save-for-quick-boot-m76.png)

Saving the current state will make the emulator boot faster when this virtual
device is launched again. For more information about Quick Boot, see
[Quick Boot](~/android/deploy-test/debugging/debug-on-emulator.md#quick-boot).

### New Device

To create a new device, click the **New Device** button (located in the upper

<a name="troubleshooting" />

## Troubleshooting

The following sections explain how to diagnose and work around problems
that may occur when using the Android Device Manager to configure
virtual devices.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/windows)

### Android SDK in Non-Standard Location

Typically, the Android SDK is installed at the following location:

**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk**

If the SDK is not installed at this location, you may get this error when you launch
the Android Device Manager:

![Android SDK instance error](device-manager-images/win/29-sdk-error.png)

To work around this problem, use the following steps:

1. From the Windows desktop, navigate to
   **C:\\Users\\*username*\\AppData\\Roaming\\XamarinDeviceManager**:

   ![Android Device Manager log file location](device-manager-images/win/30-log-files.png)

2. Double-click to open one of the log files and locate the **Config
   file path**. For example:

   [![Config file path in log file](device-manager-images/win/31-config-file-path-sml.png)](device-manager-images/win/31-config-file-path.png#lightbox)

3. Navigate to this location and double-click **user.config** to open it.

4. In **user.config**, locate the `<UserSettings>` element and add an
   **AndroidSdkPath** attribute to it. Set this attribute to the path
   where the Android SDK is installed on your computer and save the
   file. For example, `<UserSettings>` would look like the following if
   the Android SDK was installed at **C:\\Programs\\Android\\SDK**:

   ```xml
   <UserSettings SdkLibLastWriteTimeUtcTicks="636409365200000000" AndroidSdkPath="C:ProgramsAndroidSDK" />
   ```

After making this change to **user.config**, you should be able to
launch the Android Device Manager.


### Wrong Version of Android SDK Tools

If Android SDK tools 26.1.1 or later is not installed, you may see this
error dialog on launch:

![Android SDK instance error dialog](device-manager-images/win/32-sdk-instance-error.png)

If you see this error dialog, click **Open SDK Manager** to open the
Android SDK Manager. In the Android SDK Manager, click the **Tools**
tab and install the following packages:

- **Android SDK Tools 26.1.1** or later
- **Android SDK Platform-Tools 27.0.1** or later
- **Android SDK Build-Tools 27.0.3** or later


### Snapshot disables WiFi on Android Oreo

If you have an AVD configured for Android Oreo with simulated Wi-Fi access,
restarting the AVD after a snapshot may cause Wi-Fi access to become disabled.

To work around this problem,

1. Select the AVD in the Android Device Manager.

2. From the additional options menu, click **Reveal in Explorer**.

3. Navigate to **snapshots > default_boot**.

4. Delete the **snapshot.pb** file:

   ![Location of the snapshot.pb file](device-manager-images/win/33-delete-snapshot.png)

5. Restart the AVD.

After these changes are made, the AVD will restart in a state that
allows Wi-Fi to work again.


# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/macos)

### Wrong Version of Android SDK Tools

If Android SDK tools 26.1.1 or later is not installed, you may see this
error dialog on launch:

![Android SDK instance error dialog](device-manager-images/mac/29-sdk-instance-error.png)

### Snapshot disables WiFi on Android Oreo

If you have an AVD configured for Android Oreo with simulated Wi-Fi access,
restarting the AVD after a snapshot may cause Wi-Fi access to become disabled.

To work around this problem,

1. Select the AVD in the Android Device Manager.

2. From the additional options menu, click **Reveal in Finder**.

3. Navigate to **snapshots > default_boot**.

4. Delete the **snapshot.pb** file:

5. Restart the AVD.

After these changes are made, the AVD will restart in a state that
allows Wi-Fi to work again.

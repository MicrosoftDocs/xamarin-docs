title: "Start Developing Android Apps with Xamarin.Android"
description: "Xamarin.Android makes it possible for you to create native Android applications using the same UI controls as you would in Java, but with the flexibility and elegance of a modern language (C#), the power of the .NET Base Class Library (BCL), and a first-class IDE (Visual Studio) at your fingertips. This series introduces the basics of Xamarin.Android development. It takes you from setup and installation to building your first application."

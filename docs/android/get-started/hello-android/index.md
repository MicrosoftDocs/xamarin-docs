# Hello, Android

_In this two-part guide, you will build your first Xamarin.Android application using Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio and develop an understanding of the fundamentals of Android application development with Xamarin. Along the way, the tools, concepts, and steps required to build and deploy a Xamarin.Android application will be introduced._

## [Part 1: Quickstart](~/android/get-started/hello-android/hello-android-quickstart.md)

In the first part of this guide you'll create an application that
translates an alphanumeric phone number entered by the user into a
numeric phone number, and then calls that number.

## [Part 2: Deep Dive](~/android/get-started/hello-android/hello-android-deepdive.md)

In the second part of this document, you'll review what was built and
develop a fundamental understanding of how Android applications work.

# Using SQLite.NET with Android

The SQLite.NET library that Xamarin recommends is a very basic ORM that
lets you easily store and retrieve objects in the local SQLite database
on an Android device. ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping &ndash; an
API that lets you save and retrieve "objects" from a database
without writing SQL statements.

To include the SQLite.NET library in a Xamarin app, add the following NuGet package to your project:

- **Package Name:** sqlite-net-pcl
- **Author:** Frank A. Krueger
- **Id:** sqlite-net-pcl
- **Url:** [nuget.org/packages/sqlite-net-pcl](https://www.nuget.org/packages/sqlite-net-pcl/)

[![SQLite.NET NuGet package](using-sqlite-orm-images/image1a-sml.png "SQLite.NET NuGet package")](using-sqlite-orm-images/image1a.png#lightbox)

> [!TIP]
> There are a number of different SQLite packages available â€“ be sure to choose the correct one (it might not be the top result in search).

Once you have the SQLite.NET library available, follow these three steps to use it to access a database:

1. **Add a using statement** &ndash; Add the following statement to the C#
    files where data access is required:

    ```csharp
    using SQLite;
    ```

2. **Create a Blank Database** &ndash; A database reference can be
    created by passing the file path the SQLiteConnection class
    constructor. You do not need to check if the file already exists
    &ndash; it will automatically be created if required, otherwise the
    existing database file will be opened. The `dbPath` variable should
    be determined according the rules discussed earlier in this
    document:

    ```csharp
    var db = new SQLiteConnection (dbPath);
    ```

3. **Save Data** &ndash; Once you have created a SQLiteConnection
    object, database commands are executed by calling its methods, such
    as CreateTable and Insert like this:

    ```csharp
    db.CreateTable<Stock> ();
    db.Insert (newStock); // after creating the newStock object
    ```

4. **Retrieve Data** &ndash; To retrieve an object (or a list of
    objects) use the following syntax:

    ```csharp
    var stock = db.Get<Stock>(5); // primary key id of 5
    var stockList = db.Table<Stock>();
    ```

## Basic Data Access Sample

The *DataAccess_Basic* sample code for this document looks like this
when running on Android. The code illustrates how to perform simple
SQLite.NET operations and shows the results in as text in the
application's main window.

**Android**

![Android SQLite.NET sample](using-sqlite-orm-images/image3.png "Android SQLite.NET sample")

The following code sample shows an entire database interaction using
the SQLite.NET library to encapsulate the underlying database access.
It shows:

1. Creating the database file

2. Inserting some data by creating objects and then saving them

3. Querying the data

You'll need to include these namespaces:

```csharp
using SQLite; // from the github SQLite.cs class
```

The last one requires that you have added SQLite to your project. Note
that the SQLite database table is defined by adding attributes to a
class (the `Stock` class) rather than a CREATE TABLE command.

```csharp
[Table("Items")]
public class Stock {
    [PrimaryKey, AutoIncrement, Column("_id")]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    [MaxLength(8)]
    public string Symbol { get; set; }
}
public static void DoSomeDataAccess () {
       Console.WriteLine ("Creating database, if it doesn't already exist");
   string dbPath = Path.Combine (
        Environment.GetFolderPath (Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal),
        "ormdemo.db3");
   var db = new SQLiteConnection (dbPath);
   db.CreateTable<Stock> ();
   if (db.Table<Stock> ().Count() == 0) {
        // only insert the data if it doesn't already exist
        var newStock = new Stock ();
        newStock.Symbol = "AAPL";
        db.Insert (newStock);
        newStock = new Stock ();
        newStock.Symbol = "GOOG";
        db.Insert (newStock);
        newStock = new Stock ();
        newStock.Symbol = "MSFT";
        db.Insert (newStock);
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Reading data");
    var table = db.Table<Stock> ();
    foreach (var s in table) {
        Console.WriteLine (s.Id + " " + s.Symbol);
    }
}
```

Using the `[Table]` attribute without specifying a table name parameter
will cause the underlying database table to have the same name as the
class (in this case, "Stock"). The actual table name is important
if you write SQL queries directly against the database rather than use
the ORM data access methods. Similarly the `[Column("_id")]` attribute
is optional, and if absent a column will be added to the table with the
same name as the property in the class.

## SQLite Attributes

Common attributes that you can apply to your classes to control how
they are stored in the underlying database include:

- **[PrimaryKey]** &ndash; This attribute can be applied to an
    integer property to force it to be the underlying table's primary
    key. Composite primary keys are not supported.

- **[AutoIncrement]** &ndash; This attribute will cause an integer
    property's value to be auto-increment for each new object inserted
    into the database

- **[Column(name)]** &ndash; The `name` parameter
    sets the underlying database column's name.

- **[Table(name)]** &ndash; Marks the class as being able to be
    stored in an underlying SQLite table with the name specified.

- **[MaxLength(value)]** &ndash; Restrict the length of a text
    property, when a database insert is attempted. Consuming code
    should validate this prior to inserting the object as this
    attribute is only 'checked' when a database insert or update
    operation is attempted.

- **[Ignore]** &ndash; Causes SQLite.NET to ignore this property.
    This is particularly useful for properties that have a type that
    cannot be stored in the database, or properties that model
    collections that cannot be resolved automatically by SQLite.

- **[Unique]** &ndash; Ensures that the values in the underlying
    database column are unique.

Most of these attributes are optional. You should always specify an integer
primary key so that selection and deletion queries can be performed
efficiently on your data.

## More Complex Queries

The following methods on `SQLiteConnection` can be used to perform other data operations:

- **Insert** &ndash; Adds a new object to the database.

- **Get&lt;T&gt;** &ndash; Attempts to retrieve an object using the
    primary key.

- **Table&lt;T&gt;** &ndash; Returns all the objects in the table.

- **Delete** &ndash; Deletes an object using its primary key.

- **Query&lt;T&gt;** &ndash; Perform an SQL query that returns a number of
    rows (as objects).

- **Execute** &ndash; Use this method (and not `Query`) when you
    don't expect rows back from the SQL (such as INSERT, UPDATE and
    DELETE instructions).

### Getting an object by the primary key

SQLite.Net provides the Get method to retrieve a single object based on its primary key.

```csharp
var existingItem = db.Get<Stock>(3);
```

### Selecting an object using Linq

Methods that return collections support `IEnumerable<T>` so you can use
Linq to query or sort the contents of a table. The following code shows
an example using Linq to filter out all entries that begin with the
letter "A":

```csharp
var apple = from s in db.Table<Stock>()
    where s.Symbol.StartsWith ("A")
    select s;
Console.WriteLine ("-> " + apple.FirstOrDefault ().Symbol);
```

### Selecting an object using SQL

Even though SQLite.Net can provide object-based access to your data,
sometimes you might need to do a more complex query than Linq allows
(or you may need faster performance). You can use SQL commands with the
Query method, as shown here:

```csharp
var stocksStartingWithA = db.Query<Stock>("SELECT * FROM Items WHERE Symbol = ?", "A");
foreach (var s in stocksStartingWithA) {
    Console.WriteLine ("a " + s.Symbol);
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> When writing SQL statements directly you create a
> dependency on the names of tables and columns in your database, which
> have been generated from your classes and their attributes. If you
> change those names in your code you must remember to update any
> manually written SQL statements.

### Deleting an object

The primary key is used to delete the row, as shown here:

```csharp
var rowcount = db.Delete<Stock>(someStock.Id); // Id is the primary key
```

You can check the `rowcount` to confirm how many rows were affected
(deleted in this case).

## Using SQLite.NET with Multiple Threads

SQLite supports three different threading modes: *Single-thread*,
*Multi-thread*, and *Serialized*. If you want to access the database
from multiple threads without any restrictions, you can configure
SQLite to use the **Serialized** threading mode. It's important to set
this mode early in your application (for example, at the beginning of
the `OnCreate` method).

To change the threading mode, call `SqliteConnection.SetConfig`. For
example, this line of code configures SQLite for **Serialized** mode:

```csharp
using using Mono.Data.Sqlite;
...
SqliteConnection.SetConfig(SQLiteConfig.Serialized);
```

The Android version of SQLite has a limitation that requires a few more
steps. If the call to `SqliteConnection.SetConfig` produces a SQLite
exception such as `library used incorrectly`, then you must use the
following workaround:

1. Link to the native **libsqlite.so** library so that the
   `sqlite3_shutdown` and `sqlite3_initialize` APIs are made
    available to the app:

    ```csharp
    [DllImport("libsqlite.so")]
    internal static extern int sqlite3_shutdown();

    [DllImport("libsqlite.so")]
    internal static extern int sqlite3_initialize();
    ```

2. At the very beginning of the `OnCreate` method, add this code
    to shutdown SQLite, configure it for **Serialized** mode, and
    reinitialize SQLite:

    ```csharp
    using using Mono.Data.Sqlite;
    ...
    sqlite3_shutdown();
    SqliteConnection.SetConfig(SQLiteConfig.Serialized);
    sqlite3_initialize();
    ```

This workaround also works for the `Mono.Data.Sqlite` library. For more
information about SQLite and multi-threading, see
[SQLite and Multiple Threads](https://www.sqlite.org/threadsafe.html).

# Data and Cloud Services

## Data and Cloud Services

Xamarin.Android applications often need access to data (from either a
local database or from the cloud), and many of these apps consume web
services implemented using a wide variety of technologies. The guides
in this section examine how to access data and make use of cloud
services.

## [Data Access](~/android/data-cloud/data-access/index.md)

This section discusses data access in Xamarin.Android using SQLite as
the database engine.
 
## [Google Messaging](~/android/data-cloud/google-messaging/index.md)

Google provides both Firebase Cloud Messaging and legacy Google Cloud
Messaging services for facilitating messaging between mobile apps and
server applications. This section provides overviews for each service
provided by step-by-step explanation of how to use these services to
implement remote notifications (also called push notifications) in
Xamarin.Android applications.

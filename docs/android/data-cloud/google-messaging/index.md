# Google Messaging

_This section contains guides that describe how to implement Xamarin.Android apps using Google messaging services._

## [Firebase Cloud Messaging](firebase-cloud-messaging.md)

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a service that facilitates messaging
between mobile apps and server applications. FCM is Google's successor
to Google Cloud Messaging. This article provides an overview of how FCM
works, and it provides a step-by-step procedure for acquiring
credentials so that your app can use FCM services.

## [Remote Notifications with Firebase Cloud Messaging](remote-notifications-with-fcm.md)

This walkthrough provides a step-by-step explanation of how to use
Firebase Cloud Messaging to implement remote notifications (also called
push notifications) in a Xamarin.Android application. It illustrates
how to implement the various classes that are needed for communications
with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), provides examples of how to
configure the Android Manifest for access to FCM, and demonstrates
downstream messaging using the Firebase Console.

## [Google Cloud Messaging](google-cloud-messaging.md)

This section provides a high-level overview of how Google Cloud
Messaging (GCM) routes messages between your app and an app server, and
it provides a step-by-step procedure for acquiring credentials so that
your app can use GCM services. (Note that GCM has been superceded
by FCM.)

> [!NOTE]
> GCM has been superceded by [Firebase Cloud Messaging](~/android/data-cloud/google-messaging/firebase-cloud-messaging.md) (FCM).
> GCM server and client APIs [have been deprecated](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2018/04/time-to-upgrade-from-gcm-to-fcm.html)
> and will no longer be available as soon as April 11th, 2019.

## [Remote Notifications with Google Cloud Messaging](remote-notifications-with-gcm.md)

This section provides a step-by-step explanation of how to implement
remote notifications in Xamarin.Android using Google Cloud Messaging.
It explains the various components that must be leveraged to enable
Google Cloud Messaging in an Android application.

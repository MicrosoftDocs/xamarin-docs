# Binding a .JAR

_This walkthrough provides step-by-step instructions for creating a Xamarin.Android Java Bindings Library from an Android .JAR file._

## Overview

The Android community offers many Java libraries that you may want to 
use in your app. These Java libraries are often packaged in .JAR (Java 
Archive) format, but you can package a .JAR it in a *Java Bindings 
Library* so that its functionality is available to Xamarin.Android 
apps. The purpose of the Java Bindings library is to make the APIs in 
the .JAR file available to C# code through automatically-generated code 
wrappers.

Xamarin tooling can generate a Bindings Library from one or more input 
.JAR files. The Bindings Library (.DLL assembly) contains the 
following: 

-   The contents of the original .JAR file(s).

-   Managed Callable Wrappers (MCW), which are C# types that wrap corresponding
    Java types within the .JAR file(s).

The generated MCW code uses JNI (Java Native Interface) to forward your 
API calls to the underlying .JAR file. You can create bindings 
libraries for any .JAR file that was originally targeted to be used 
with Android (note that Xamarin tooling does not currently support the 
binding of non-Android Java libraries). You can also elect to build
the Bindings Library without including the contents of the .JAR
file so that the DLL has a dependency on the .JAR at runtime.

In this guide, we'll step through the basics of creating a Bindings
Library for a single .JAR file. We'll illustrate with an example where 
everything goes right &ndash; that is, where no customization or 
debugging of bindings is required. 
[Creating Bindings Using Metadata](~/android/platform/binding-java-library/customizing-bindings/java-bindings-metadata.md) 
offers an example of a more advanced scenario where the binding process 
is not entirely automatic and some amount of manual intervention is 
required. For an overview of Java library binding in general (with a 
basic code example), see 
[Binding a Java Library](~/android/platform/binding-java-library/index.md). 

 
## Walkthrough

In the following walkthrough, we'll create a Bindings Library for 
[Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/), a popular Android .JAR 
that provides image loading and caching functionality. We will use the 
following steps to bind **picasso-2.x.x.jar** to create a new .NET 
assembly that we can use in a Xamarin.Android project: 

1. Create a new Java Bindings Library project.

2. Add the .JAR file to the project.

3. Set the appropriate build action for the .JAR file.

4. Choose a target framework that the .JAR supports.

5. Build the Bindings Library.

Once we've created the Bindings Library, we'll develop a small Android 
app that demonstrates our ability to call APIs in the Bindings Library. 
In this example, we want to access methods of **picasso-2.x.x.jar**:

```java
package com.squareup.picasso

public class Picasso
{ 
    ...
    public static Picasso with (Context context) { ... };
    ...
    public RequestCreator load (String path) { ... };
    ...
}
```

After we generate a Bindings Library for **picasso-2.x.x.jar**,
we can call these methods from C#. For example:

```csharp
using Com.Squareup.Picasso;
...
Picasso.With (this)
    .Load ("http://mydomain.myimage.jpg")
    .Into (imageView);

```


### Creating the Bindings Library

Before commencing with the steps below, please download 
[picasso-2.x.x.jar](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/squareup/picasso/picasso/2.5.2/picasso-2.5.2.jar).

First, create a new Bindings Library project. In Visual Studio for Mac or 
Visual Studio, create a new Solution and select the *Android 
Bindings Library* template. (The screenshots in this walkthrough 
use Visual Studio, but Visual Studio for Mac is very similar.) Name the 
Solution **JarBinding**: 

[![Create JarBinding library project](binding-a-jar-images/01-new-bindings-library-sml.w157.png)](binding-a-jar-images/01-new-bindings-library.w157.png#lightbox)

The template includes a **Jars** folder where you add your .JAR(s) 
to the Bindings Library project. Right-click the **Jars** folder 
and select **Add > Existing Item**: 

[![Add existing item](binding-a-jar-images/02-add-existing-item-sml.png)](binding-a-jar-images/02-add-existing-item.png#lightbox)

Navigate to the **picasso-2.x.x.jar** file downloaded earlier, select it and
click **Add**: 

[![Select jar file and click Add](binding-a-jar-images/03-select-jar-file-sml.png)](binding-a-jar-images/03-select-jar-file.png#lightbox)

Verify that the **picasso-2.x.x.jar** file was successfully added 
to the project: 

[![Jar added to project](binding-a-jar-images/04-jar-added-sml.png)](binding-a-jar-images/04-jar-added.png#lightbox)

When you create a Java Bindings library project, you must specify 
whether the .JAR is to be embedded in the Bindings Library 
or packaged separately. To do that, you specify one of the 
following *build actions*: 

-   **EmbeddedJar** &ndash; the .JAR will be embedded in the Bindings Library.

-   **InputJar** &ndash; the .JAR will be kept separate from the Bindings
    Library.

Typically, you use the **EmbeddedJar** build action so that the 
.JAR is automatically packaged into the bindings library. This is 
the simplest option &ndash; Java bytecode in the .JAR is converted 
into Dex bytecode and is embedded (along with the Managed Callable 
Wrappers) into your APK. If you want to keep the .JAR separate from 
the bindings library, you can use the **InputJar** option; however, 
you must ensure that the .JAR file is available on the device that 
runs your app. 

Set the build action to **EmbeddedJar**: 

[![Select EmbeddedJar build action](binding-a-jar-images/05-embeddedjar-sml.png)](binding-a-jar-images/05-embeddedjar.png#lightbox)

Next, open the project Properties to configure the *Target 
Framework*. If the .JAR uses any Android APIs, set the Target 
Framework to the API level that the .JAR expects. Typically, the 
developer of the .JAR file will indicate which API level (or 
levels) that the .JAR is compatible with. 
(For more information about the Target Framework setting and Android API levels
in general, see 
[Understanding Android API Levels](~/android/app-fundamentals/android-api-levels.md).)

Set the target API level for your Bindings Library (in this example, we are using
API level 19): 

[![Target API level set to API 19](binding-a-jar-images/06-set-target-framework-sml.png)](binding-a-jar-images/06-set-target-framework.png#lightbox)


Finally, build the Bindings Library. Although some warning messages may be displayed,
the Bindings Library project should build successfully and produce an output .DLL
at the following location: **JarBinding/bin/Debug/JarBinding.dll**
    


### Using the Bindings Library

To consume this .DLL in your Xamarin.Android app, do the following:

1.  Add a reference to the Bindings Library.

2.  Make calls into the .JAR through the Managed Callable Wrappers. 

In the following steps, we'll create a minimal app that uses the 
Bindings Library to download and display an image in an `ImageView`; 
the "heavy lifting" is done by the code that resides in the .JAR file. 

First, create a new Xamarin.Android app that consumes 
the Bindings Library. Right-click the Solution and select **Add New 
Project**; name the new project **BindingTest**. We're 
creating this app in the same Solution as the Bindings Library in 
order to simplify this walkthrough; however, the app that consumes
the Bindings Library could, instead, reside in a different Solution: 

[![Add new BindingTest project](binding-a-jar-images/07-add-new-project-sml.w157.png)](binding-a-jar-images/07-add-new-project.w157.png#lightbox)

Right-click the **References** node of the **BindingTest** project and 
select **Add Reference...**:

[![Right Add Reference](binding-a-jar-images/08-add-reference.png)](binding-a-jar-images/08-add-reference.png#lightbox)

Check the **JarBinding** project created earlier and click **OK**:

[![Select JarBinding project](binding-a-jar-images/09-choose-jar-binding-sml.png)](binding-a-jar-images/09-choose-jar-binding.png#lightbox)

Open the **References** node of the **BindingTest** project and 
verify that the **JarBinding** reference is present: 

[![JarBinding appears under References](binding-a-jar-images/10-references-shows-jarbinding-sml.png)](binding-a-jar-images/10-references-shows-jarbinding.png#lightbox)

Modify the **BindingTest** layout (**Main.axml**) so that it has a single `ImageView`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:minWidth="25px"
    android:minHeight="25px">
    <ImageView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:id="@+id/imageView" />
</LinearLayout>
```

Add the following `using` statement to **MainActivity.cs** &ndash; this makes it possible
to easily access the methods of the Java-based `Picasso` class that resides in the
Bindings Library:

```csharp
using Com.Squareup.Picasso;
```

Modify the `OnCreate` method so that it uses the `Picasso` class to 
load an image from a URL and display it in the `ImageView`: 

```csharp
public class MainActivity : Activity
{
    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)
    {
        base.OnCreate(bundle);
        SetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main);
        ImageView imageView = FindViewById<ImageView>(Resource.Id.imageView);

        // Use the Picasso jar library to load and display this image:
        Picasso.With (this)
            .Load ("http://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.jpg")
            .Into (imageView);
    }
}
```

Compile and run the **BindingTest** project. The app will startup, and after a short delay 
(depending on network conditions), it should download and display an image similar to
the following screenshot:

[![Screenshot of BindingTest running](binding-a-jar-images/11-result-sml.png)](binding-a-jar-images/11-result.png#lightbox)

Congratulations! You've successfully bound a Java library .JAR and used it in your 
Xamarin.Android app.
 
 
## Summary

In this walkthrough, we created a Bindings Library for a third-party 
.JAR file, added the Bindings Library to a minimal test app, and then 
ran the app to verify that our C# code can call Java code residing in 
the .JAR file.

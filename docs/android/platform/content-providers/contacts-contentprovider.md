# Using the Contacts ContentProvider

Code that uses access data exposed by a `ContentProvider` doesn't
require a reference to the `ContentProvider` class at all. Instead, a
Uri is used to create a cursor over the data exposed by the
`ContentProvider`. Android uses the Uri to search the system for the
application that exposes a `ContentProvider` with that identifier. The
Uri is a string, typically in a reverse-DNS format such as
`com.android.contacts/data`.

Rather than making developers remember this string, the Android
*Contacts* provider exposes its metadata in the
`android.provider.ContactsContract` class. This class is used to
determine the Uri of the `ContentProvider` as well as the names of the
tables and columns that can be queried.

Some data types also require special permission to access. The built-in
contacts list requires the `android.permission.READ_CONTACTS`
permission in the **AndroidManifest.xml** file.

There are three ways to create a cursor from the Uri:

1. **ManagedQuery()** &ndash; The preferred approach in Android 2.3
   (API Level 10) and earlier, a `ManagedQuery` returns a cursor and
   also automatically manages refreshing the data and closing the
   cursor. This method is deprecated in Android 3.0 (API Level 11).

1. **ContentResolver.Query()** &ndash; Returns an unmanaged cursor,
   which means it must be refreshed and closed explicitly in code.

1. **CursorLoader().LoadInBackground()** &ndash; Introduced in Android
   3.0 (API Level 11), `CursorLoader` is now the preferred way to
   consume a `ContentProvider` . `CursorLoader` queries a
   `ContentResolver` on a background thread so the UI isn't blocked.
   This class can be accessed in older versions of Android using the v4
   compatibility library.

Each of these methods has the same basic set of inputs:

- **Uri** &ndash; The fully qualified name of the  `ContentProvider` .
- **Projection** &ndash; Specification of which columns to select for the cursor.
- **Selection** &ndash; Similar to a SQL  `WHERE` clause.
- **SelectionArgs** &ndash; Parameters to be substituted in the Selection.
- **SortOrder** &ndash; Columns to sort by.

## Creating Inputs for a Query

The `ContactsProvider` sample code performs a very simple query against
Android's built-in Contacts provider. You do not need to know the
actual Uri or column names - all the information required to query the
Contacts `ContentProvider` is available as constants exposed by the
`ContactsContract` class.

Regardless of which method is used to retrieve the cursor, these same objects
are used as parameters as shown in the *ContactsProvider/ContactsAdapter.cs* file:

```csharp
var uri = ContactsContract.Contacts.ContentUri;
string[] projection = {
   ContactsContract.Contacts.InterfaceConsts.Id,
   ContactsContract.Contacts.InterfaceConsts.DisplayName,
   ContactsContract.Contacts.InterfaceConsts.PhotoId,
};
```

For this example, the `selection`, `selectionArgs` and `sortOrder` will be ignored
by setting them to `null`.

## Creating a Cursor from a Content Provider Uri

Once the parameter objects have been created, they can be used in one
of the following three ways:

### Using a Managed Query

Applications targeting Android 2.3 (API Level 10) or earlier should use this
method:

```csharp
var cursor = activity.ManagedQuery(uri, projection, null, null, null);
```

This cursor will be managed by Android so you do not need to close it.

### Using ContentResolver

Accessing `ContentResolver` directly to get a cursor against a
`ContentProvider` can be done like this:

```csharp
var cursor = activity.ContentResolver(uri, projection, null, null, null);
```

This cursor is unmanaged, so it must be closed when no longer required.
Ensure that the code closes a cursor that is open, otherwise an error
will occur.

```csharp
cursor.Close();
```

Alternatively, you can call `StartManagingCursor()` and
`StopManagingCursor()` to 'manage' the cursor. Managed cursors are
automatically deactivated and re-queried when Activities are stopped
and restarted.

### Using CursorLoader

Applications built for Android 3.0 (API Level 11) or newer should use
this method:

```csharp
var loader = new CursorLoader (activity, uri, projection, null, null, null);
var cursor = (ICursor)loader.LoadInBackground();
```

The `CursorLoader` ensures that all cursor operations are done on a
background thread, and can intelligently re-use an existing cursor
across activity instances when an activity is restarted (e.g. due to a
configuration change) rather that reload the data again.

Earlier Android versions can also use the `CursorLoader` class by using the
[v4 support libraries](https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html).

## Displaying the Cursor Data with a Custom Adapter

To display the contact image we'll use a custom adapter, so that we can
manually resolve the `PhotoId` reference to an image file path.

To display data with a custom adapter, the example uses a
`CursorLoader` to retrieve all the Contact data into a local collection
in the **FillContacts** method from
**ContactsProvider/ContactsAdapter.cs**:

```csharp
void FillContacts ()
{
   var uri = ContactsContract.Contacts.ContentUri;
   string[] projection = {
       ContactsContract.Contacts.InterfaceConsts.Id,
       ContactsContract.Contacts.InterfaceConsts.DisplayName,
       ContactsContract.Contacts.InterfaceConsts.PhotoId
  };
   // CursorLoader introduced in Honeycomb (3.0, API11)
   var loader = new CursorLoader(activity, uri, projection, null, null, null);
   var cursor = (ICursor)loader.LoadInBackground();
   contactList = new List<Contact> ();
   if (cursor.MoveToFirst ()) {
      do {
          contactList.Add (new Contact{
              Id = cursor.GetLong (cursor.GetColumnIndex (projection [0])),
              DisplayName = cursor.GetString (cursor.GetColumnIndex (projection [1])),
              PhotoId = cursor.GetString (cursor.GetColumnIndex (projection [2]))
          });
       } while (cursor.MoveToNext());
   }
}
```

Then implement the BaseAdapter's methods using the `contactList`
collection. The adapter is implemented just as it would be with any
other collection &ndash; there is no special handling here because the
data is sourced from a `ContentProvider`:

```csharp
Activity activity;
public ContactsAdapter (Activity activity)
{
   this.activity = activity;
   FillContacts ();
}
public override int Count {
   get { return contactList.Count; }
}
public override Java.Lang.Object GetItem (int position)
{
  return null; // could wrap a Contact in a Java.Lang.Object to return it here if needed
}
public override long GetItemId (int position)
{
   return contactList [position].Id;
}
public override View GetView (int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent)
{
   var view = convertView ?? activity.LayoutInflater.Inflate (Resource.Layout.ContactListItem, parent, false);
   var contactName = view.FindViewById<TextView> (Resource.Id.ContactName);
   var contactImage = view.FindViewById<ImageView> (Resource.Id.ContactImage);
   contactName.Text = contactList [position].DisplayName;
   if (contactList [position].PhotoId == null) {
       contactImage = view.FindViewById<ImageView> (Resource.Id.ContactImage);
       contactImage.SetImageResource (Resource.Drawable.ContactImage);
   } else {
       var contactUri = ContentUris.WithAppendedId (ContactsContract.Contacts.ContentUri, contactList [position].Id);
       var contactPhotoUri = Android.Net.Uri.WithAppendedPath (contactUri, Contacts.Photos.ContentDirectory);
       contactImage.SetImageURI (contactPhotoUri);
   }
   return view;
}
```

The image is displayed (if it exists) using the Uri to the image file on the
device. The application looks like this:

[![Screenshot of app displaying contacts in a ListView; an image is displayed to the left of one entry](contacts-contentprovider-images/contactsprovider.png)](contacts-contentprovider-images/contactsprovider.png#lightbox)

Using a similar code pattern, your application can access a wide
variety of system data including the user's photos, videos and music.
Some data types require special permissions to be requested in the
project's **AndroidManifest.xml**.

## Displaying the Cursor Data with a SimpleCursorAdapter

The cursor could also be displayed with a `SimpleCursorAdapter`
(although only the name will be displayed, not the photo). This code
demonstrates how to use a `ContentProvider` with `SimpleCursorAdapter`
(this code does not appear in the sample):

```csharp
var uri = ContactsContract.Contacts.ContentUri;
string[] projection = {
   ContactsContract.Contacts.InterfaceConsts.Id,
   ContactsContract.Contacts.InterfaceConsts.DisplayName
};
var loader = new CursorLoader (this, uri, projection, null, null, null);
var cursor = (ICursor)loader.LoadInBackground();
var fromColumns = new string[] {ContactsContract.Contacts.InterfaceConsts.DisplayName};
var toControlIds = new int[] {Android.Resource.Id.Text1};
adapter = new SimpleCursorAdapter (this, Android.Resource.Layout.SimpleListItem1, cursor, fromColumns, toControlsIds);
listView.Adapter = adapter;
```

Refer to the
[ListViews and Adapters](~/android/user-interface/layouts/list-view/index.md)
for further information on implementing `SimpleCursorAdapter`.

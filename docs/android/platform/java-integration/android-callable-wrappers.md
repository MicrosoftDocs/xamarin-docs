# Android Callable Wrappers for Xamarin.Android

Android Callable Wrappers (ACWs) are required whenever the Android 
runtime invokes managed code. These wrappers are required because there 
is no way to register classes with ART (the Android runtime) at 
runtime. (Specifically, the 
[JNI DefineClass() function](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/spec/functions.html#wp15986) 
is not supported by the Android runtime.} Android Callable 
Wrappers thus make up for the lack of runtime type registration 
support. 

*Every time* Android code needs to execute a `virtual` or interface 
method that is `overridden` or implemented in managed code, 
Xamarin.Android must provide a Java proxy so that this method is 
dispatched to the appropriate managed type. These Java proxy types are 
Java code that has the "same" base class and Java interface list as 
the managed type, implementing the same constructors and declaring any 
overridden base class and interface methods. 

Android callable wrappers are generated by the **monodroid.exe** 
program during the 
[build process](~/android/deploy-test/building-apps/build-process.md): they 
are generated for all types that (directly or indirectly) inherit 
[Java.Lang.Object](xref:Java.Lang.Object). 



## Android Callable Wrapper Naming

Package names for Android Callable Wrappers are based on the MD5SUM of 
the assembly-qualified name of the type being exported. This naming 
technique makes it possible for the same fully-qualified type name to 
be made available by different assemblies without introducing a 
packaging error. 

Because of this MD5SUM naming scheme, you cannot directly access your 
types by name. For example, the following `adb` command will not work 
because the type name `my.ActivityType` is not generated by default: 

```shell
adb shell am start -n My.Package.Name/my.ActivityType
```

Also, you may see errors like the following if you attempt to reference
a type by name:

```shell
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "com.company.app.MainActivity"
on path: DexPathList[[zip file "/data/app/com.company.App-1.apk"] ...
```

If you *do* require access to types by name, you can declare a name for 
that type in an attribute declaration. For example, here is code that
declares an activity with the fully-qualified name `My.ActivityType`:

```csharp
namespace My {
    [Activity]
    public partial class ActivityType : Activity {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

The `ActivityAttribute.Name` property can be set to explicitly declare 
the name of this activity: 

```csharp
namespace My {
    [Activity(Name="my.ActivityType")]
    public partial class ActivityType : Activity {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

After this property setting is added, `my.ActivityType` can be accessed 
by name from external code and from `adb` scripts. The `Name` attribute 
can be set for many different types including `Activity`, 
`Application`, `Service`, `BroadcastReceiver`, and `ContentProvider`: 

- [ActivityAttribute.Name](xref:Android.App.ActivityAttribute.Name)
- [ApplicationAttribute.Name](xref:Android.App.ApplicationAttribute.Name)
- [ServiceAttribute.Name](xref:Android.App.ServiceAttribute.Name)
- [BroadcastReceiverAttribute.Name](xref:Android.Content.BroadcastReceiverAttribute.Name)
- [ContentProviderAttribute.Name](xref:Android.Content.ContentProviderAttribute.Name)

MD5SUM-based ACW naming was introduced in Xamarin.Android 5.0. For more 
information about attribute naming, see 
[RegisterAttribute](xref:Android.Runtime.RegisterAttribute). 



## Implementing Interfaces

There are times when you may need to implement an Android interface, such as 
[Android.Content.IComponentCallbacks](xref:Android.Content.IComponentCallbacks). 
Since all Android classes and interface extend the 
[Android.Runtime.IJavaObject](xref:Android.Runtime.IJavaObject) 
interface, the question arises: how do we implement `IJavaObject`? 

The question was answered above: the reason all Android types need to 
implement `IJavaObject` is so that Xamarin.Android has an Android 
callable wrapper to provide to Android, i.e. a Java proxy for the given 
type. Since **monodroid.exe** only looks for `Java.Lang.Object` 
subclasses, and `Java.Lang.Object` implements `IJavaObject,` the answer 
is obvious: subclass `Java.Lang.Object`: 

```csharp
class MyComponentCallbacks : Java.Lang.Object, Android.Content.IComponentCallbacks {

    public void OnConfigurationChanged (Android.Content.Res.Configuration newConfig)
    {
        // implementation goes here...
    } 

    public void OnLowMemory ()
    {
        // implementation goes here...
    }
}
```


## Implementation Details

*The remainder of this page provides implementation details subject to 
change without notice* (and is presented here only because developers will 
be curious about what's going on). 

For example, given the following C# source:

```csharp
using System;
using Android.App;
using Android.OS;

namespace Mono.Samples.HelloWorld
{
    public class HelloAndroid : Activity
    {
        protected override void OnCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState)
        {
            base.OnCreate (savedInstanceState);
            SetContentView (R.layout.main);
        }
    }
}
```

The **mandroid.exe** program will generate the following Android 
Callable Wrapper: 

```java
package mono.samples.helloWorld;

public class HelloAndroid
    extends android.app.Activity
{
    static final String __md_methods;
    static {
        __md_methods = "n_onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V:GetOnCreate_Landroid_os_Bundle_Handler\n" + "";
        mono.android.Runtime.register (
            "Mono.Samples.HelloWorld.HelloAndroid, HelloWorld, Version=1.0.0.0, 
            Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null", HelloAndroid.class, __md_methods);
    }

    public HelloAndroid ()
    {
        super ();
        if (getClass () == HelloAndroid.class)
            mono.android.TypeManager.Activate (
                "Mono.Samples.HelloWorld.HelloAndroid, HelloWorld, Version=1.0.0.0, 
                Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null", "", this, new java.lang.Object[] {  });
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate (android.os.Bundle p0)
    {
        n_onCreate (p0);
    }

    private native void n_onCreate (android.os.Bundle p0);
}
```

Notice that the base class is preserved, and `native` method 
declarations are provided for each method that is overridden within 
managed code.

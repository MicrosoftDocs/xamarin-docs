Pie display cutout and notification features in Xamarin.Android apps.


## [Android 8 Oreo](~/android/platform/oreo.md)

This article provides an outline of the new features in Android Oreo,
explains how to prepare Xamarin.Android for Android Oreo development,
and provides links to sample applications that illustrate how to use

## [Introduction to Content Providers](~/android/platform/content-providers/index.md)

A ContentProvider encapsulates a data repository and provides an API to
access it. The provider exists as part of an Android application that
also provides a UI for displaying/managing the data. The key benefit of
using a content provider is enabling other applications to easily
access the encapsulated data using a provider client object (called a
ContentResolver). Together a content provider and content resolver
offer a consistent inter-application API for data access that is simple
to build and consume. This document shows how to access and build
ContentProviders with Xamarin.Android.



## [Maps and Location](~/android/platform/maps-and-location/index.md)

This section discusses how to use maps and location with
Xamarin.Android. It covers everything from leveraging the built-in maps
application to using the
[Google Maps Android API v2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/)

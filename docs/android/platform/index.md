## [Introduction to Content Providers](~/android/platform/content-providers/index.md)

A ContentProvider encapsulates a data repository and provides an API to
access it. The provider exists as part of an Android application that
also provides a UI for displaying/managing the data. The key benefit of
using a content provider is enabling other applications to easily
access the encapsulated data using a provider client object (called a
ContentResolver). Together a content provider and content resolver
offer a consistent inter-application API for data access that is simple
to build and consume. This document shows how to access and build
ContentProviders with Xamarin.Android.

## [Maps and Location](~/android/platform/maps-and-location/index.md)

# Maps and Location on Android

## [Location Services](~/android/platform/maps-and-location/location.md)

This guide introduces location-awareness in Android applications, and illustrates how to get the user's location using the Android Location Service API, as well as the Fused Location Provider available with the Google Location Services API.

## [Maps](~/android/platform/maps-and-location/maps/index.md)

This article discusses how to use maps and location with Xamarin.Android. It covers everything from leveraging the built-in maps application to using the Google Maps Android API V2 directly. Additionally, it explains how to use a single API to work with location services, which allows an application to obtain location fixes via cell tower location, Wi-Fi or GPS.

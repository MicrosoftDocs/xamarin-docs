# How to use Google Maps and Location with Xamarin.Android

_This article discusses how to use maps and location with Xamarin.Android. It covers everything from leveraging the built-in maps application to using the Google Maps Android API V2 directly._

## Maps Overview

Mapping technologies are a ubiquitous complement to mobile devices. 
Desktop computers and laptops don't tend to have location awareness 
built-in. On the other hand, mobile devices use such applications to 
locate devices and to display changing location information. Android 
has powerful, built-in technology that displays location data on 
maps using location hardware that may be available on the device. This 
article covers a spectrum of what the maps applications under 
Xamarin.Android have to offer, including: 

- Using the built-in maps application to quickly add mapping functionality.
- Working with the Maps API to control a map's display.
- Using a variety of techniques to add graphical overlays.

The topics in this section cover a wide range of mapping features.
First, they explain how to leverage Android's built-in maps application
and how to display a panoramic street view of a location. Then they
discuss how to use the Maps API to incorporate mapping features
directly within an application, covering both how to control the
position and display of a map, as well as how to add graphical
overlays.

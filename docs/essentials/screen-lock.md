# Xamarin.Essentials Screen Lock

![Pre-release NuGet](~/media/shared/pre-release.png)

The **ScreenLock** class can request to keep the screen from falling asleep when the application is running.

## Using ScreenLock

Add a reference to Xamarin.Essentials in your class:

```csharp
using Xamarin.Essentials;
```

The screen lock functionality works by calling the `RequestActive` and `RequestRelease` methods to request the screen from turning off.

```csharp
public class ScreenLockTest
{
    public void ToggleScreenLock()
    {
        if (!ScreenLock.IsActive)
            ScreenLock.RequestActive();
        else
            ScreenLock.RequestRelease();
    }
}
```

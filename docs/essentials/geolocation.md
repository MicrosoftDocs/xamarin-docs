# Xamarin.Essentials: Geolocation

![Pre-release NuGet](~/media/shared/pre-release.png)

The **Geolocation** class provides APIs to retrieve the device's current geolocation coordinates.

## Get started

[!include[](~/essentials/includes/get-started.md)]

To access the **Geolocation** functionality, the following platform-specific setup is required:

# [Android](#tab/android)

Coarse and Fine Location permissions are required and must be configured in the Android project. Additionally, if your app targets Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher, you must declare that your app uses the hardware features in the manifest file. This can be added in the following ways:

Open the **AssemblyInfo.cs** file under the **Properties** folder and add:

```csharp
[assembly: UsesPermission(Android.Manifest.Permission.AccessCoarseLocation)]
[assembly: UsesPermission(Android.Manifest.Permission.AccessFineLocation)]
[assembly: UsesFeature("android.hardware.location", Required = false)]
[assembly: UsesFeature("android.hardware.location.gps", Required = false)]
[assembly: UsesFeature("android.hardware.location.network", Required = false)]
```

Or update the Android manifest:

Open the **AndroidManifest.xml** file under the **Properties** folder and add the following inside of the **manifest** node:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.location" android:required="false" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.location.gps" android:required="false" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.location.network" android:required="false" />
```

Or right-click on the Android project and open the project's properties. Under **Android Manifest** find the **Required permissions:** area and check the **ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** and **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** permissions. This will automatically update the **AndroidManifest.xml** file.

# [iOS](#tab/ios)

Your app's **Info.plist** must contain the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` key in order to access the deviceâ€™s location.

Open the plist editor and add the **Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description** property and fill in a value to display the user.

Or manually edit the file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access location when open.</string>
```

# [UWP](#tab/uwp)

You must set the `Location` permission for the application. This can be done by opening the **Package.appxmanifest** and selecting the **Capabilities** tab and checking **Location**.

## Using Geolocation

Add a reference to Xamarin.Essentials in your class:

```csharp
using Xamarin.Essentials;
```

The Geolocation API will also prompt the user for permissions when necessary.

You can get the last known [location](xref:Xamarin.Essentials.Location) of the device by calling the `GetLastKnownLocationAsync` method. This is often faster then doing a full query, but can be less accurate.

```csharp
try
{
    var location = await Geolocation.GetLastKnownLocationAsync();

    if (location != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Latitude: {location.Latitude}, Longitude: {location.Longitude}, Altitude: {location.Altitude}");
    }
}
catch (FeatureNotSupportedException fnsEx)
{
    // Handle not supported on device exception
}
catch (PermissionException pEx)
{
    // Handle permission exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Unable to get location
}
```

The altitude isn't always available. If it is not available, the `Altitude` property might be `null` or the value might be zero. If the altitude is available, the value is in meters above above sea level. 

To query the current device's [location](xref:Xamarin.Essentials.Location) coordinates, the `GetLocationAsync` can be used. It is best to pass in a full `GeolocationRequest` and `CancellationToken` since it may take some time to get the device's location.

```csharp
try
{
    var request = new GeolocationRequest(GeolocationAccuracy.Medium);
    var location = await Geolocation.GetLocationAsync(request);

    if (location != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Latitude: {location.Latitude}, Longitude: {location.Longitude}, Altitude: {location.Altitude}");
    }
}
catch (FeatureNotSupportedException fnsEx)
{
    // Handle not supported on device exception
}
catch (PermissionException pEx)
{
    // Handle permission exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Unable to get location
}
```

## Geolocation Accuracy

The following table outlines accuracy per platform:

### Lowest

| Platform | Distance (in meters) |
| --- | --- |
| Android | 500 |
| iOS | 3000 |
| UWP | 1000 - 5000 |

### Low

| Platform | Distance (in meters) |
| --- | --- |
| Android | 500 |
| iOS | 1000 |
| UWP | 300 - 3000 |

### Medium (default)

| Platform | Distance (in meters) |
| --- | --- |
| Android | 100 - 500 |
| iOS | 100 |
| UWP | 30-500 |

### High

| Platform | Distance (in meters) |
| --- | --- |
| Android | 0 - 100 |
| iOS | 10 |
| UWP | <= 10 |

### Best

| Platform | Distance (in meters) |
| --- | --- |
| Android | 0 - 100 |
| iOS | ~0 |
| UWP | <= 10 |

## Distance between Two Locations

The [`Location`](xref:Xamarin.Essentials.Location) and [`LocationExtensions`](xref:Xamarin.Essentials.LocationExtensions) classes define `CalculateDistance` methods that allow you to calculate the distance between two geographic locations. This calculated distance does not take roads or other pathways into account, and is merely the shortest distance between the two points along the surface of the Earth, also known as the _great-circle distance_ or colloquially, the distance "as the crow flies."

Here's an example:

```csharp
Location boston = new Location(42.358056, -71.063611);
Location sanFrancisco = new Location(37.783333, -122.416667);
double miles = Location.CalculateDistance(boston, sanFrancisco, DistanceUnits.Miles);
```

The `Location` constructor has latitude and longitude arguments in that order. Positive latitude values are north of the equator, and positive longitude values are east of the Prime Meridian. Use the final argument to `CalculateDistance` to specify miles or kilometers. The `Location` class also defines `KilometersToMiles` and `MilesToKilometers` methods for converting between the two units.

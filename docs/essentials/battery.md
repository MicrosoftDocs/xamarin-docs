# Xamarin.Essentials: Battery

The **Battery** class lets you check the device's battery information and monitor for changes and provides information about the device's energy-saver status, which indicates if the device is running in a low-power mode. Applications should avoid background processing if the device's energy-saver status is on.

## Get started

[!include[](~/essentials/includes/get-started.md)]

To access the **Battery** functionality the following platform specific setup is required.

# [Android](#tab/android)

The `Battery` permission is required and must be configured in the Android project. This can be added in the following ways:

Open the **AssemblyInfo.cs** file under the **Properties** folder and add:

```csharp
[assembly: UsesPermission(Android.Manifest.Permission.BatteryStats)]
```

OR Update Android Manifest:

Open the **AndroidManifest.xml** file under the **Properties** folder and add the following inside of the **manifest** node.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BATTERY_STATS" />
```

Or right click on the Android project and open the project's properties. Under **Android Manifest** find the **Required permissions:** area and check the **Battery** permission. This will automatically update the **AndroidManifest.xml** file.

# [iOS](#tab/ios)

No additional setup required.

# [UWP](#tab/uwp)

No additional setup required.

## Using Battery

Add a reference to Xamarin.Essentials in your class:

```csharp
using Xamarin.Essentials;
```

Check current battery information:

```csharp
var level = Battery.ChargeLevel; // returns 0.0 to 1.0 or 1.0 when on AC or no battery.

var state = Battery.State;

switch (state)
{
    case BatteryState.Charging:
        // Currently charging
        break;
    case BatteryState.Full:
        // Battery is full
        break;
    case BatteryState.Discharging:
    case BatteryState.NotCharging:
        // Currently discharging battery or not being charged
        break;
    case BatteryState.NotPresent:
        // Battery doesn't exist in device (desktop computer)
    case BatteryState.Unknown:
        // Unable to detect battery state
        break;
}

var source = Battery.PowerSource;

switch (source)
{
    case BatteryPowerSource.Battery:
        // Being powered by the battery
        break;
    case BatteryPowerSource.AC:
        // Being powered by A/C unit
        break;
    case BatteryPowerSource.Usb:
        // Being powered by USB cable
        break;
    case BatteryPowerSource.Wireless:
        // Powered via wireless charging
        break;
    case BatteryPowerSource.Unknown:
        // Unable to detect power source
        break;
}
```

Whenever any of the battery's properties change an event is triggered:

```csharp
public class BatteryTest
{
    public BatteryTest()
    {
        // Register for battery changes, be sure to unsubscribe when needed
        Battery.BatteryInfoChanged += Battery_BatteryInfoChanged;
    }

    void Battery_BatteryInfoChanged(object sender, BatteryInfoChangedEventArgs   e)
    {
        var level = e.ChargeLevel;
        var state = e.State;
        var source = e.PowerSource;
        Console.WriteLine($"Reading: Level: {level}, State: {state}, Source: {source}");
    }
}
```

Devices that run on batteries can be put into a low-power energy-saver mode. Sometimes devices are switched into this mode automatically, for example, when the battery drops below 20% capacity. The operating system responds to energy-saver mode by reducing activities that tend to deplete the battery. Applications can help by avoiding background processing or other high-power activities when energy-saver mode is on.

You can also obtain the current energy-saver status of the device using the static `Battery.EnergySaverStatus` property:

```csharp
// Get energy saver status
var status = Battery.EnergySaverStatus;
```

This property returns a member of the `EnergySaverStatus` enumeration, which is either `On`, `Off`, or `Unknown`. If the property returns `On`, the application should avoid background processing or other activities that might consume a lot of power.

The application should also install an event handler. The **Battery** class exposes an event that is triggered when the energy-saver status changes:

```csharp
public class EnergySaverTest
{
    public EnergySaverTest()
    {
        // Subscribe to changes of energy-saver status
        Battery.EnergySaverStatusChanged += OnEnergySaverStatusChanged;
    }

    private void OnEnergySaverStatusChanged(EnergySaverStatusChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        // Process change
        var status = e.EnergySaverStatus;
    }
}
```

If the energy-saver status changes to `On`, the application should stop performing background processing. If the status changes to `Unknown` or `Off`, the application can resume background processing.


## Platform Differences

# [Android](#tab/android)

No platform differences.

# [iOS](#tab/ios)

* Device must be used to test APIs. 
* Only will return `AC` or `Battery` for `PowerSource`.

# [UWP](#tab/uwp)

* Only will return `AC` or `Battery` for `PowerSource`.

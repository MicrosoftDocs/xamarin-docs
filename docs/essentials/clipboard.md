# Xamarin.Essentials: Clipboard

The **Clipboard** class lets you copy and paste text to the system clipboard between applications.

## Get started

[!include[](~/essentials/includes/get-started.md)]

## Using Clipboard

Add a reference to Xamarin.Essentials in your class:

```csharp
using Xamarin.Essentials;
```

To check if the **Clipboard** has text currently ready to be pasted:

```csharp
var hasText = Clipboard.HasText;
```

To set text to the **Clipboard**:

```csharp
await Clipboard.SetTextAsync("Hello World");
```

To read text from the **Clipboard**:

```csharp
var text = await Clipboard.GetTextAsync();
```

> [!TIP]
> Access to the Clipboard must be done on the main user interface thread. See the [MainThread](~/essentials/main-thread.md) API to see how to invoke methods on the main user interface thread.

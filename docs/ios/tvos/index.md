# Introduction to tvOS in Xamarin

## Introducing tvOS

Apple has released the 5th generation of the Apple TV hardware, the Apple TV 4K, which runs the latest version of the tvOS operating system, based on iOS 11.

The Apple TV platform is open to developers, allowing them to create rich, immersive apps and release them through the Apple TV's built-in App Store.

For more information on tvOS, please see the [Getting Started](~/ios/tvos/get-started/index.md) document.

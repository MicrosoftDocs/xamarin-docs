## Adding a tvOS Release Version

Whether you are creating a new App to be released on the Apple TV App Store, or adding Apple TV support to an existing iOS app, you'll need to have created an iTunes Connect Record and configured it using the following iOS specific guides:

- [Creating an iTunes Connect Record](~/ios/deploy-test/app-distribution/app-store-distribution/itunesconnect.md#creating)
- [Managing App Videos and Screenshots](~/ios/deploy-test/app-distribution/app-store-distribution/itunesconnect.md#managing)
- [Managing Name, Description, What's New, Keywords and URLs](~/ios/deploy-test/app-distribution/app-store-distribution/itunesconnect.md#metadata)
- [Maintaining General Information](~/ios/deploy-test/app-distribution/app-store-distribution/itunesconnect.md#general)

Optionally, you might also require:

- [Maintaining Game Center Information](~/ios/deploy-test/app-distribution/app-store-distribution/itunesconnect.md#game-center)
- [Maintaining In-App Purchase Information](~/ios/deploy-test/app-distribution/app-store-distribution/itunesconnect.md#iap)

With all of the above steps completed, open your app's iTunes Connect Record and select to add tvOS support using the left hand sidebar:

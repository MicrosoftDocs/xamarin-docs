# Troubleshooting tvOS 10 Apps Built With Xamarin

The following sections list some known issues that can occur when using tvOS 10 with Xamarin and the solution to those issues:

- [App Store](#App-Store)
- [Binary Compatibility](#Binary-Compatibility)
- [CFNetwork HTTP Protocol](#CFNetwork-HTTP-Protocol)
- [CloudKit](#CloudKit)
- [Core Image](#CoreImage)
- [NSUserActivity](#NSUserActivity)
- [UIKit](#UIKit)

<a name="App-Store" />

## App Store

Known Issues:

- When testing In-App Purchases in the sandbox environment, the authentication dialog may appear twice.
- When testing In-App Purchases with hosted content in the sandbox environment, the password dialog will appear every time the app is brought to the foreground until the content download completes.

<a name="Binary-Compatibility" />

## Binary Compatibility

Known Issues:

- Calling `NSObject.ValueForKey` will a `null` key will result in an exception.
- Referencing a font by name when calling `UIFont.WithName` will cause a crash.
- Both `NSURLSession` and `NSURLConnection` no longer RC4 cipher suites during the TLS handshake for `http://` URLs.
- Apps can hang if they modify a superview's geometry in either the `ViewWillLayoutSubviews` or `LayoutSubviews` methods.
- For all SSL/TLS connections, the RC4 symmetric cipher is now disabled by default. Additionally, the Secure Transport API no longer supports SSLv3 and it is recommended that the app stop using SHA-1 and 3DES cryptography as soon as possible.

<a name="CFNetwork-HTTP-Protocol" />

## CFNetwork HTTP Protocol

The `HTTPBodyStream` property of the `NSMutableURLRequest` class must be set to an unopened stream since `NSURLConnection` and `NSURLSession` now strictly enforce this requirement.

<a name="CloudKit" />

## CloudKit

Long running operations will return a _"You don't have permission to save the file."_ error.

<a name="CoreImage" />

## Core Image

The `CIImageProcessor` API now supports an arbitrary input image count. `CIImageProcessor` API that was included in tvOS 10 beta 1 will be removed.

<a name="NSUserActivity" />

## NSUserActivity

After a Handoff operation, the `UserInfo` property of a `NSUserActivity` object might be empty. Explicitly call `BecomeCurrent` NSUserActivity` object as a current workaround.

<a name="UIKit" />

## UIKit

Known Issues:

- Changes to the background appearance of `UINavigationBar`, `UITabBar` or `UIToolBar` may result in a layout pass to resolve the new appearance. Attempting to modify these appearances inside of a `LayoutSubviews`, `UpdateConstraints`, `WillLayoutSubviews` or `DidUpdateSubviews` event can result in an infinite layout loop.
- In tvOS 10, calling the `RemoveGestureRecognizer` method of a `UIView` object explicitly cancels any in-progress Gesture Recognizer.
- Presented View Controllers can now affect the appearance of the status bar.
- tvOS 10 requires the developer to call `base.AwakeFromNib` when subclassing `UIViewController` and overriding the `AwakeFromNib` method.
- Apps with custom `UIView` subclasses that override `LayoutSubviews` and dirty the layout before calling `base.LayoutSubviews` may trigger an infinite layout loop in tvOS 10.
- Direction-specific or flippable images assets are no flipping when assigned to `UIButton` objects.

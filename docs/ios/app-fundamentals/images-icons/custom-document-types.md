# Custom Document Icons in Xamarin.iOS

_This article covers including and managing an image asset in a Xamarin.iOS app to be used as a Custom Document Type Icon._

If a Xamarin.iOS app supports loading a particular document type, the developer can provide icons that the system will use when it encounters that document type, such as when a user holds down an attachment in the *Mail Application* as shown here:

The developer can add document type information for a file format the app is capable of opening by including dictionary entries for the `CFBundleTypeName` string and `LSItemContentTypes` array in the app's `Info.plist`. The icons for the document type go in the `CFBundleTypeIconFiles` array. If a document icon isn't provided, iOS will derive one from the app icon.
Icons can be supplied for several sizes, optimized for the various device resolutions. 

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/macos)

To assign these values in Visual Studio for Mac, use the **Document Types** section under the **Advanced** tab on the `Info.plist`
editor to add the document type and assign image icons to it. For
example, here is a screenshot showing registration for PDF support:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/windows)

To assign these values in Visual Studio, use the **Document Types** section under the **Advanced** tab on the `Info.plist`:

Click the **Add Document Type** button and fill in the required fields:

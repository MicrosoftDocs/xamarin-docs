# Application lifecycle demo for Xamarin.iOS

This article and [sample code](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/ios-samples/lifecycledemo) demonstrates the four application states in iOS, and the role of the `AppDelegate` methods in notifying the application of when states get changed. The application will print updates to the console whenever the app changes state:

## Walkthrough

1. Open the **Lifecycle** project in the **LifecycleDemo** solution.
1. Open up the `AppDelegate` class. Logging has been added to the lifecycle methods to indicate when the application has changed state:

    ```csharp
    public override void OnActivated(UIApplication application)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("OnActivated called, App is active.");
    }
    public override void WillEnterForeground(UIApplication application)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("App will enter foreground");
    }
    public override void OnResignActivation(UIApplication application)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("OnResignActivation called, App moving to inactive state.");
    }
    public override void DidEnterBackground(UIApplication application)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("App entering background state.");
    }
    // not guaranteed that this will run
    public override void WillTerminate(UIApplication application)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("App is terminating.");
    }
    ```

1. Launch the application in the simulator or on the device. `OnActivated` will be called when the app launches. The application is now in the _Active_ state.
1. Hit the Home button on the simulator or device to bring the application to the background. `OnResignActivation` and `DidEnterBackground` will be called as the app transitions from `Active` to `Inactive` and into the `Backgrounded` state. Since there is no application code set to execute in the background, the application is considered _suspended_ in memory.
1. Navigate back to the app to bring it back into the foreground. `WillEnterForeground` and `OnActivated` will both be called:

    ![](application-lifecycle-demo-images/image4.png "State changes printed to the console")

    The following line of code in the view controller is executed when the application has entered the foreground from the background, and changes the text displayed on the screen:

    ```csharp
    UIApplication.Notifications.ObserveWillEnterForeground ((sender, args) => {
        label.Text = "Welcome back!";
    });
    ```

1. Press the **Home** button to put the application into the background. Then, double-tap the **Home** button to bring up the application switcher. On the iPhone X, swipe up from the bottom of the screen:

    [![The application switcher](application-lifecycle-demo-images/app-switcher-sml.png "The application switcher")](application-lifecycle-demo-images/app-switcher.png#lightbox)
  
1. Locate the application in the App Switcher, and swipe up to remove it (on iOS 11, long press until the red icons appear in the corner):

    [![Swipe up to remove a running app](application-lifecycle-demo-images/app-switcher-swipe-sml.png "Swipe up to remove a running app")](application-lifecycle-demo-images/app-switcher-swipe.png#lightbox)

iOS will terminate the application. Note that `WillTerminate` is not called because application is already _suspended_ in the background.

# iOS Backgrounding Techniques

In the following sections, we will explore the following iOS features alongside the existing backgrounding options:

- [Opportunistic Background Tasks](~/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/ios-backgrounding-techniques/ios-backgrounding-with-tasks.md#background_tasks_in_iOS_7) - Preserve battery life by running background tasks in opportunistic chunks when the device is awake for other processing.
- [Background Transfer Service](~/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/ios-backgrounding-techniques/ios-backgrounding-with-tasks.md#background-transfers) - Reliably upload and download files regardless of network status or file size.
- [Background Fetch](~/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/ios-backgrounding-techniques/updating-an-application-in-the-background.md#background_fetch) - Refresh an application from the background at system-determined intervals.
- [Remote Notifications](~/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/ios-backgrounding-techniques/updating-an-application-in-the-background.md#remote_notifications) - Use push notifications to trigger content updates in the background before the user opens the application, with an option to notify the user or update silently.
- **Background UI Updates** - Prepare the application UI for the user, and update the application's snapshot, all from the background.

# iOS Backgrounding Walkthroughs

##  [Walkthrough - Using Background Location](~/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/ios-backgrounding-walkthroughs/location-walkthrough.md)

In this example, we build an iOS Location application that prints information about our current location - latitude, longitude, and other parameters - to the screen. This application will demonstrate how to properly perform location updates while the application is either Active or Backgrounded.

##  [Walkthrough - Using Background Transfer Service and NSURLSession](~/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/ios-backgrounding-walkthroughs/background-transfer-walkthrough.md)

In this walkthrough, we use the Background Transfer Service and `NSURLSession` API to kick off downloading a large image that continues to download when the app is in the background.

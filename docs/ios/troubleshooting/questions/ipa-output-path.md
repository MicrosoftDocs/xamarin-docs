# Can I change the output path of the IPA file?

## For Cycle 7 and higher
Yes, you can use customized MSBuild targets to achieve this. The easiest option is probably to copy the `.ipa` file after it has been built.

These steps will work for any iOS project that uses the MSBuild build engine on either Mac or Windows. (Note: all Unified API projects use the MSBuild build engine.)

1. Open the `.csproj` file for the iOS app project in a text editor and then add the following lines at the end (immediately before the closing `</Project>` tag):
	
	```
	<PropertyGroup>
		   <CreateIpaDependsOn>
	       $(CreateIpaDependsOn);
			CopyIpa
	       </CreateIpaDependsOn>
	</PropertyGroup>
	
	<Target Name="CopyIpa"
		Condition="'$(OutputType)' == 'Exe'
			And '$(ComputedPlatform)' == 'iPhone'
			And '$(BuildIpa)' == 'true'">
		<Copy
			SourceFiles="$(IpaPackagePath)"
			DestinationFolder="$(OutputPath)"
		/>
	</Target>
	```

2. Set the DestinationFolder to the desired output folder. As usual you may use MSBuild properties (like $(OutputPath)) within this argument if you wish.

## Notes
- The `CreateIpaDependsOn` property is defined in the `Xamarin.iOS.Common.targets` file that is part of Xamarin.iOS. It behaves as described in the [Overriding Predefined Targets](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-extend-the-visual-studio-build-process#overriding-predefined-targets) section of the article [How to: Extend the Visual Studio Build Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-extend-the-visual-studio-build-process).

- You could use a **Move** Task rather than a **Copy** Task if you preferred. If you choose that option and you are building on Windows, you will need to use the fully-qualified task name `<Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Move>` to avoid an ambiguity with the XamarinVS build tasks.

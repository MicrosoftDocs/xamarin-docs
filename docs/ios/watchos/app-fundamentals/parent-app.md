# Working with the watchOS Parent Application in Xamarin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Accessing the parent application using the examples below
only works on watchOS 1 watch apps.


There are different ways to communicate between the watch
app and the iOS app that it is bundled with:

- Watch extensions can [call a method](#code) against the parent app
  that runs in the background on the iPhone.

- Watch extensions can [share a storage location](#storage)
  with the parent iPhone app.

- Using Handoff to pass data from a Glance or
  Notification to the Watch app, sending the user
  to a specific interface controller in the app.

The Parent App is also sometimes referred to as the Container App.


<a name="code" />

## Run Code

Communicating between a watch extension and the parent
iPhone app is demonstrated in the [GpsWatch sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/ios-samples/watchkit-gpswatch).
Your watch extension can request the parent iOS app
to do some processing on its behalf using the `OpenParentApplication`
method.

This is especially useful for long running tasks (including
network requests) - only the parent iOS app can take advantage of
background processing to complete these tasks and save the
retrieved data in a location accessible to the watch extension.



### Watch Kit App Extension

Call the `WKInterfaceController.OpenParentApplication` in your watch
app extension. It returns a `bool` that indicates whether the
method request was sent successfully or not. Check the `error`
parameter in the response `Action` to determine if any occurred during
the method running in the iPhone app.

```csharp
WKInterfaceController.OpenParentApplication (new NSDictionary (), (replyInfo, error) => {
    if(error != null) {
        Console.WriteLine (error);
        return;
    }
    Console.WriteLine ("parent app responded");
    // do something with replyInfo[] dictionary
});
```


### iOS App

All calls from a watch app extension are routed through
the iPhone app's `HandleWatchKitExtensionRequest` method.
If you are making different requests in the watch app
then this method will need to query the `userInfo` dictionary
to determine how to process the request.


```csharp
[Register ("AppDelegate")]
public partial class AppDelegate : UIApplicationDelegate
{
    // ... other AppDelegate methods
    public override void HandleWatchKitExtensionRequest
        (UIApplication application, NSDictionary userInfo, Action<NSDictionary> reply)
    {
        var status = 2;
        // do something in the background, and respond
        reply (new NSDictionary (
            "count", NSNumber.FromInt32 ((int)status),
            "value2", new NSString("some-info")
            ));
    }
}
```


<a name="storage" />

## Shared Storage

If you configure an [app group](~/ios/watchos/app-fundamentals/app-groups.md)
then iOS 8 extensions (including watch extensions) can share data
with the parent app.

<a name="nsuserdefaults" />

### NSUserDefaults

The following code can be written in both the watch app
extension and the parent iPhone app so that they can
reference a common set of `NSUserDefaults`:

```csharp
NSUserDefaults shared = new NSUserDefaults(
        "group.com.your-company.watchstuff",
        NSUserDefaultsType.SuiteName);

// set values
shared.SetInt (2, "count");
shared.Synchronize ();

// get values
shared.Synchronize ();
var count = shared.IntForKey ("count");
```

<a name="files" />

### Files

The iOS app and watch extension can also share files
using a common file path.

```csharp
var FileManager = new NSFileManager ();
var appGroupContainer =
            FileManager.GetContainerUrl ("group.com.your-company.watchstuff");
var appGroupContainerPath = appGroupContainer.Path;
Console.WriteLine ("agcpath: " + appGroupContainerPath);
// use the path to create and update files
```

Note: if the path is `null` then check the
[app group configuration](~/ios/watchos/app-fundamentals/app-groups.md)
to ensure the provisioning profiles have been configured correctly
and have been downloaded/installed on the development computer.

For more information, please see the [App Group Capabilities](~/ios/deploy-test/provisioning/capabilities/app-groups-capabilities.md) documentation.

## WormHoleSharp

A popular open-source mechanism for watchOS 1 (based on [MMWormHole](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMWormhole))
to pass data or commands between the parent
app and the watch app.

You can configure WormHole using an app group like this
in your iOS app and watch extension:

```csharp
// AppDelegate (iOS) or InterfaceController (watch extension)
Wormhole wormHole;
// ...
wormHole = new Wormhole ("group.com.your-company.watchstuff", "messageDir");
```

Download the C# version [WormHoleSharp](https://github.com/Clancey/WormHoleSharp).

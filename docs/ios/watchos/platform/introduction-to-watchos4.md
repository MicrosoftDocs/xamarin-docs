# Introduction to watchOS 4

Access new features of watchOS 4 in your apps:

* Connect directly to network resources with cellular data available on some Apple Watch Series 3 models.
* Core Bluetooth can connect directly to accessories.
* New background modes for workout and audio apps.

Changes since watchOS 3:

# Introduction to watchOS 5

This document provides a high-level description of some watchOS 5 APIs.

To get started building watchOS 5 apps with Xamarin, take a look at:

- The [getting started guide](~/ios/platform/introduction-to-ios12/get-started.md)
- The Xamarin preview [release blog post](https://releases.xamarin.com/preview-release-xcode-10-beta-6/)

## Workout improvements

The workout APIs in watchOS 5 provide new features for workout data
collection, saving workouts to HealthKit, automatically continuing a
workout after an app crashes, and working with a series of related
quantity data.

## Siri shortcuts

In watchOS 5, the Siri watch face shows shortcuts that surface app content
and functionality to users at convenient times. Siri learns over time to
show relevant shortcuts when they are most likely to be used.

## Background audio mode

watchOS 5 makes it possible for third-party apps to play audio in the
background through the AV Foundation framework.

## Movement Disorder API

The Movement Disorder API, part of the CoreMotion framework in watchOS 5,
allows watchOS applications to monitor, record, and query tremor and
dyskinesia symptoms related to Parkinson's disease.

## Natural Language framework

The Natural Language framework enables applications to perform various
types of language analysis. For example, it can be used to identify parts
of speech and determine the language represented by a block of text.

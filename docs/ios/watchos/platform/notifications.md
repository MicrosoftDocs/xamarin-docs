# watchOS Notifications in Xamarin

Watch apps can receive notifications if the containing
  iOS app supports them. There is built-in notification handling
  so you do not *need* to add the additional notification
  support described below, however if you wish to customize
  notification behavior and appearance then read on.

Refer to the [iOS Notifications](~/ios/platform/user-notifications/deprecated/index.md)
  doc for more information on adding notification support
  to the iOS app in your solution.

## Creating Notification Controllers

On the storyboard notifications controllers have a
  special type of segue triggering them. When you drag
  a new **Notification Interface Controller** onto a
  storyboard it will automatically have a segue attached:

![](notifications-images/notification-storyboard1.png "A new Notification Interface Controller with a segue attached")

When the notification segue is selected you can edit
  its properties:

![](notifications-images/notification-storyboard2.png "The notification segue selected")

After you have customized the controller it may look like
  this example from the WatchKitCatalog:

![](notifications-images/notifications-segue.png "The Notification Properties")

There are two types of notification:

- **Short-look** - non-scrollable static view
  defined by the system.

- **Long-look** - scrollable, customizable view
  defined by you! A simpler, static version and
  a more complex dynamic version can be specified.

### Short-Look Notification Controller

The short-look UI consists of just the app icon,
  app name and the notification title string.

If the user does not ignore the notification,
  the system will automatically switch to
  a long-look notification that provides
  more information.

### Long-Look Notification Controller

The OS decides whether to display the static or dynamic
  view based on a number of factors. You must provide
  a static interface, and can optionally also include
  a dynamic interface for notifications.

#### Static

The static view should be simple and quick to display.

#### Dynamic

The dynamic view can display more data and provide
  more interactivity.

## Generating Notifications

Notifications can come from a remote server or can be generated locally in the iOS app.

Refer to the [iOS Notifications walkthrough](~/ios/platform/user-notifications/deprecated/local-notifications-in-ios-walkthrough.md) for an example of how to generate
  local notifications.

Local notifications must have the `AlertTitle` set to be displayed on the Apple Watch -
  the `AlertTitle` string is displayed in the Short-Look interface. Both the `AlertTitle`
  and `AlertBody` are displayed in the notifications list; and the `AlertBody` is displayed
  in the Long-Look interface.

This screenshot shows the `AlertTitle` being displayed in the notifications list, and the
  `AlertBody` displayed in the Long-Look interface:

## Testing Notifications

Notifications (both local and remote) can only be properly tested on a device,
  however they can be simulated using a **.json** file in the iOS Simulator.

### Testing on Apple Watch

When testing notifications on an Apple Watch, remember that [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/BasicSupport.html) states the following:

> When one of your app’s local or remote notifications arrives on the user’s iPhone, iOS decides whether to display that notification on the iPhone or on the Apple Watch.

This is alluding to the fact that iOS decides whether a notification will
  appear on the iPhone or on the Watch. If the paired iPhone is active when
  a notification is received, the notification is likely to be displayed on the
  iPhone and *not* routed to the Watch.

To ensure the notification appears on the watch, turn off the iPhone screen
  (pressing the power button once) or let it go to sleep. If the paired Watch
  is in range, has power and is being worn on your wrist, the notification will
  be routed there and appear on the Watch (accompanied by a subtle ).

### Testing on the iOS Simulator

You *must* provide a test JSON payload when
  testing notification mode in the iOS Simulator. Set the path in the
  **Custom Execution Arguments** window in Visual Studio for Mac.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/macos)

Visual Studio for Mac will display additional options when a
  watch extension is set as the **Startup project**.
  Right-click on the watch extension project and choose
  **Run With > Custom Parameters...**:

[![](notifications-images/runwith-customparams-sml.png "Running with Custom Properties")](notifications-images/runwith-customparams.png#lightbox)

This opens the **Execution Arguments** window which contains a **WatchKit**
  tab. Select **Notification** and provide a JSON
  payload, then press **Execute** to start the watch app in the simulator:

[![](notifications-images/runwith-execargs-sml.png "Select Notification Payload Default")](notifications-images/runwith-execargs.png#lightbox)

# [Visual Studio](#tab/windows)

To set the test notification payload in Visual Studio
  right-click on the watch extension to edit
  the **Project properties**. Go to the **Debug**
  section and select a notifications JSON file from
  the list (it will automatically list all the JSON
  files included in the project).

[![](notifications-images/runwith-execargs-sml-vs.png "Select a notifications JSON file")](notifications-images/runwith-execargs-vs.png#lightbox)

When the watch extension is the **Startup Project**,
  Visual Studio will display additional options
  as shown below. Choose one of the **Notification**
  options to start the watch app in **Notification** mode
  (using the JSON file selected in the properties window):

The default notification controller looks like this
  when testing on the simulator with the default
  payload JSON file:

![](notifications-images/notification-debug-sml.png "An example notification")

It is also possible to use the
  [command line](~/ios/watchos/troubleshooting.md#command_line)
  to start the iOS Simulator.

### Example Notification Payload

In the [Watch Kit Catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/ios-samples/watchos-watchkitcatalog) sample
  there is an example payload JSON file **NotificationPayload.json**
  (listed below).

```json
{
    "aps": {
        "alert": "Test message content",
        "title": "Optional title",
        "category": "myCategory"
        },

        "WatchKit Simulator Actions": [
        {
            "title": "First Button",
            "identifier": "firstButtonAction"
        }
        ],

        "customKey": "Use this file to define a testing payload for your notifications. The aps dictionary specifies the category, alert text and title. The WatchKit Simulator Actions array can provide info for one or more action buttons in addition to the standard Dismiss button. Any other top level keys are custom payload. If you have multiple such JSON files in your project, you'll be able to choose between them in when selecting to debug the notification interface of your Watch App."
    }
```

# Get started with iOS 13

This document describes how to start building Xamarin apps that call
APIs released with Xcode 11, for iOS 13. Using the preview requires macOS 10.14.4 (Mojave) or newer.

## Download and install

1. **Install Xcode 11** –
   Registered Apple developers can download and install the latest version
   of the Xcode 11 from the
   [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/download/) or the **App Store**.

2. **Run Xcode 11** – Run Xcode 11 before updating and running Visual
   Studio for Mac or Visual Studio 2019, as it installs some tools that Xamarin requires.

3. **Update Visual Studio for Mac and Visual Studio 2019** – Ensure you have the latest stable version of Xamarin.

4. (Optional) **Install iOS 13 on your iOS devices** – For device testing of apps 
   that use APIs introduced with the Xcode 11,
   registered Apple developers can [download](https://developer.apple.com/download)
   and install the operating system on their devices. 

   > [!TIP]
   > Even if your app does not use any new APIs, be sure to build it with
   > the newest Xcode 11 SDKs and test it to make sure that everything works
   > as expected. If an app doesn't call any new APIs, you can recompile it
   > with these new SDKs and test it on devices that have not yet been
   > upgraded to the new operating system.
   >
   > Before upgrading your devices to the latest operating system releases
   > from Apple to test your Xamarin apps, be sure to:
   >
   > - Read [Apple's release notes](https://developer.apple.com/download/)
   >   for the operating system updates.

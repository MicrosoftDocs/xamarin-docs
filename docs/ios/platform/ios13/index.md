# Introduction to iOS 13

Follow these [instructions](~/ios/platform/ios13/get-started.md) to get started.

## [Dark Mode](dark-mode.md)

iOS 13 introduces a new dark mode which provides developers with the
means to easily allow their apps to fit in. New tools enable
you to simultaneously design your apps with both light and dark themes.

## [Sign In with Apple](sign-in.md)

iOS 13 provides new functionality for signing into apps using Sign In with
Apple devices, allowing you to have more confidence that their personal
information is not being stolen or collected in any way by taking advantage
of 2FA and a restricted set of provided information.

## [Multiple windows for iPad](multi-window-ipad.md)

iPad apps can now use multiple windows created from a variety of interactions.

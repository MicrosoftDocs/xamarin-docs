# Introduction to iOS 13

![Preview feature](~/media/shared/preview.png)

Follow these [instructions](~/ios/platform/ios13/get-started.md) to get started.

## Dark Mode

iOS 13 introduces a new dark mode which provides developers with the
means to easily allow their apps to fit in. New tools enable
you to simultaneously design your apps with both light and dark themes.

## Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality in iOS 13 now has more features including a new
"People Occlusion" function which allows apps' AR content to respect the
presence of humans and move around them accordingly.

## Siri

Siri has been expanded to allow for handling of audio content as well as
better handling of shortcuts via the Shortcuts app.

## Machine Learning

Core ML 3 makes it possible for you easily train ML models using the
hardware capabilities of their devices.

## iPadOS

iPadOS is an expansion of iOS built specifically with the iPad in mind.

With iPadOS, you can make greater use of the Apple Pencil using PencilKit
with new gestures, allow for the use of multiple windows, and drag-and-drop
various content between apps. iPadOS can also allow apps to provide system-
wide fonts.

## Privacy and Security

iOS 13 provides new functionality for signing into apps using Sign In with
Apple devices, allowing you to have more confidence that their personal
information is not being stolen or collected in any way by taking advantage
of 2FA and a restricted set of provided information.

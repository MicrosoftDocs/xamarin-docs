# In-App Purchasing in Xamarin.iOS

iOS applications can sell digital products or services using StoreKit – a
set of APIs provided by iOS that communicate with Apple’s servers to conduct
financial transactions with the user via their Apple ID. The StoreKit APIs are
primarily concerned with retrieving product information and conducting
transactions – there is no user-interface component. Applications that
implement in-app purchasing must build their own user interface and track
purchased items with custom code to provide the required products or services to
the user.

Providing in-app purchase functionality requires a
number of steps:

- **Configuring your app** –The application’s provisioning profile must be setup correctly.
- **Creating products** – Product descriptions and prices must be created in the iTunes Connect portal.
- **Implementing StoreKit** – The StoreKit API must be implemented according to the types of products being sold.
- **Building the user interface and the products themselves** – The products must be implemented, including mechanisms to track each purchase and backup/restore them if appropriate.
- **Monitoring sales and receiving funds** – Use information provided by iTunes Connect to monitor sales trends and track your income.

This document explains how to complete all these steps to provide
in-app purchases using Xamarin.iOS.

## Requirements

To support In-App Purchasing you must use Xamarin.iOS 5.0 or newer with Xcode 7 and above.

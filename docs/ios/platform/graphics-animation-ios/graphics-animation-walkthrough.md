# Using Core Graphics and Core Animation in Xamarin.iOS

For this walkthrough we are going to draw a path using Core Graphics in response to touch input. Then, we will add a `CALayer` containing an image that we will animate along the path.

The following screenshot shows the completed application:

![](graphics-animation-walkthrough-images/00-final-app.png "The completed application")

Before we begin download the *GraphicsDemo* sample that accompanies this guide. It can be downloaded [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/ios-samples/graphicsandanimation) and is located inside the **GraphicsWalkthrough** directory Launch the project named **GraphicsDemo_starter** by double-clicking on it, and open the `DemoView` class.

## Drawing a Path


1. In `DemoView` add a `CGPath` variable to the class and instantiate it in the constructor. Also declare two `CGPoint` variables , `initialPoint` and `latestPoint`, that we will use to capture the touch point from which we construct the path:
	
	```csharp
	public class DemoView : UIView
	{
		CGPath path;
		CGPoint initialPoint;
		CGPoint latestPoint;
	
		public DemoView ()
		{
			BackgroundColor = UIColor.White;
	
			path = new CGPath ();
		}
	}
	```

2. Add the following using directives:

	```csharp
	using CoreGraphics;
	using CoreAnimation;
	using Foundation;
	```

3. Next, override `TouchesBegan` and `TouchesMoved,` and add the following implementations to capture the initial touch point and each subsequent touch point respectively:

	```csharp
	public override void TouchesBegan (NSSet touches, UIEvent evt){
	
		base.TouchesBegan (touches, evt);
	
		UITouch touch = touches.AnyObject as UITouch;
		
		if (touch != null) {
			initialPoint = touch.LocationInView (this);
		}
	}
	
	public override void TouchesMoved (NSSet touches, UIEvent evt){
	
		base.TouchesMoved (touches, evt);
	
		UITouch touch = touches.AnyObject as UITouch;
		
		if (touch != null) {
			latestPoint = touch.LocationInView (this);
			SetNeedsDisplay ();
		}
	}
	```

	`SetNeedsDisplay` will be called each time touches move in order for `Draw` to be called on the next run loop pass.

4. We’ll add lines to the path in the `Draw` method and use a red, dashed line to draw with. [Implement `Draw`](~/ios/platform/graphics-animation-ios/core-graphics.md) with the code shown below:

	```csharp
	public override void Draw (CGRect rect){
	
		base.Draw (rect);
	
		if (!initialPoint.IsEmpty) {
	
			//get graphics context
			using(CGContext g = UIGraphics.GetCurrentContext ()){
					
				//set up drawing attributes
				g.SetLineWidth (2);
				UIColor.Red.SetStroke ();
	
				//add lines to the touch points
				if (path.IsEmpty) {
					path.AddLines (new CGPoint[]{initialPoint, latestPoint});
				} else {
					path.AddLineToPoint (latestPoint);
				}
			
				//use a dashed line
				g.SetLineDash (0, new nfloat[] { 5, 2 * (nfloat)Math.PI });
								
				//add geometry to graphics context and draw it
				g.AddPath (path);		
				g.DrawPath (CGPathDrawingMode.Stroke);
			}
		}
	}
	```

If we run the application now, we can touch to draw on the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:

## Animating Along a Path

Now that we have implemented the code to allow users to draw the path, let’s add the code to animate a layer along the drawn path.

1. First, add a [`CALayer`](~/ios/platform/graphics-animation-ios/core-animation.md) variable to the class and create it in the constructor:

	```csharp
	public class DemoView : UIView
		{
			…
	
			CALayer layer;
	
			public DemoView (){
				…
	
				//create layer
				layer = new CALayer ();
				layer.Bounds = new CGRect (0, 0, 50, 50);
				layer.Position = new CGPoint (50, 50);
				layer.Contents = UIImage.FromFile ("monkey.png").CGImage;
				layer.ContentsGravity = CALayer.GravityResizeAspect;
				layer.BorderWidth = 1.5f;
				layer.CornerRadius = 5;
				layer.BorderColor = UIColor.Blue.CGColor;
				layer.BackgroundColor = UIColor.Purple.CGColor;
			}
	```

2. Next, we’ll add the layer as a sublayer of the view’s layer when the user lifts up their finger from the screen. Then, we will create a keyframe animation using the path, animating the layer’s `Position`.

	To accomplish this we need to override the `TouchesEnded` and add the following code:

	```csharp
	public override void TouchesEnded (NSSet touches, UIEvent evt)
		{
			base.TouchesEnded (touches, evt);

			//add layer with image and animate along path

			if (layer.SuperLayer == null)
				Layer.AddSublayer (layer);

			// create a keyframe animation for the position using the path
			layer.Position = latestPoint;
			CAKeyFrameAnimation animPosition = (CAKeyFrameAnimation)CAKeyFrameAnimation.FromKeyPath ("position");
			animPosition.Path = path;
			animPosition.Duration = 3;
			layer.AddAnimation (animPosition, "position");
		}
	```

3. Run the application now and after drawing, a layer with an image is added and travels along the drawn path:

## Summary

In this article, we stepped through an example that tied graphics and animation concepts together. First, we showed how to use Core Graphics to draw a path in a `UIView` in response to user touch. Then we showed how to use Core Animation to make an image travel along that path.

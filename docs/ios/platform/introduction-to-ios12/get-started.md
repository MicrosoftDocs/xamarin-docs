# Get started with iOS 12, tvOS 12, and watchOS 5

This document describes how to start building Xamarin apps that call
APIs released with Xcode 10, for iOS 12, tvOS 12, and watchOS 5.

## Download and install

1. **Install Xcode 10** –
   Registered Apple developers can download and install the latest version
   of Xcode 10 from the
   [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/download/) or the **App Store**.

2. **Run Xcode 10** – Run Xcode 10 before updating and running Visual
   Studio for Mac or Visual Studio 2017, as it installs some tools that
   Xamarin requires.

3. **Update Visual Studio for Mac and Visual Studio 2017** – Ensure you have the latest stable version of Xamarin.

4. _(optional)_ **Install iOS 12 on your iOS devices** –

   For device testing of apps that use APIs introduced with the Xcode 10,
   registered Apple developers can [download](https://developer.apple.com/download)
   and install the operating system on their devices.

   > [!TIP]
   > Even if your app does not use any new APIs, be sure to build it with
   > the newest Xcode 10 SDKs and test it to make sure that everything works
   > as expected. If an app doesn't call any new APIs, you can recompile it
   > with these new SDKs and test it on devices that have not yet been
   > upgraded to the new operating system.
   >
   > Before upgrading your devices to the latest operating system releases
   > from Apple to test your Xamarin apps, be sure to:
   >
   > - Read [Apple's release notes](https://developer.apple.com/download/)
   >   for the operating system updates.
   > - Read the Xamarin preview
   >   [release blog post](https://releases.xamarin.com/preview-release-xcode-10-beta-6/).

# Notifications in iOS 12

## [Critical alerts](critical-alerts.md)

iOS 12 makes it possible to send critical alerts. Critical alerts play a
sound regardless of whether or not Do Not Disturb is enabled or the ringer
switch is off.

## [Dynamic notification action buttons](dynamic-actions.md)

With iOS 12, notifications can now modify their action buttons at runtime.
Doing so makes it possible to display actions more relevant to the content
of the notification and the user's interaction with it.

## [Grouped notifications](grouped.md)

In order to help users to manage the many notifications they receive, iOS
12 can group notifications by app or by thread.

## [Interactive notifications](interactive.md)

In iOS 12, a notification's custom user interface can include interactive
controls.

## [Notification management](management.md)

iOS 12 can deep link to an app's notification management screen, making it
easier for users to enable or disable specific types of notifications.

## [Provisional notifications](provisional.md)

Provisional notifications allow apps to display quiet notifications
without requiring the user to opt in. Quiet notifications do not play a
sound and appear only in Notification Center. They provide a way for users
to preview the notifications an app sends before deciding whether or not to
allow or disallow them.

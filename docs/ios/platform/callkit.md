# CallKit in Xamarin.iOS

The new CallKit API in iOS 10 provides a way for VOIP apps to integrate with the iPhone UI and provide a familiar interface and experience to the end user. With this API users can view and interact with VOIP calls from the iOS device's Lock Screen and manage contacts using the Phone app's **Favorites** and **Recents** views.

## About CallKit

According to Apple, CallKit is a new framework that will elevate 3rd party Voice Over IP (VOIP) apps to a 1st party experience on iOS 10. The CallKit API allows VOIP apps to integrate with the iPhone UI and provide a familiar interface and experience to the end user. Just like the built-in Phone app, a user can view and interact with VOIP calls from the iOS device's Lock Screen and manage contacts using the Phone app's **Favorites** and **Recents** views.

Additionally, the CallKit API provides the ability to create App Extensions that can associate a phone number with a name (Caller ID) or tell the system when a number should be blocked (Call Blocking).

### The existing VOIP app experience

Before discussing the new CallKit API and its abilities, take a look at the current user experience with a 3rd party VOIP app in iOS 9 (and lesser) using a fictitious VOIP app called MonkeyCall. MonkeyCall is a simple app that allows the user to send and receive VOIP calls using the existing iOS APIs.

Currently, if the user is receiving an incoming call on MonkeyCall and their iPhone is locked, the notification received on the Lock screen is indistinguishable from any other type of notification (like those from the Messages or Mail apps for example).

If the user wanted to answer the call, they'd have to slide the MonkeyCall notification to open the app and enter their passcode (or user Touch ID) to unlock the phone before they could accept the call and start the conversation.

The experience is equally cumbersome if the phone is unlocked. Again, the incoming MonkeyCall call is displayed as a standard notification banner that slides in from the top of the screen. Since the notification is temporary, it can be easily missed by the user forcing them to either open the Notification Center and find the specific notification to answer then call or find and launch the MonkeyCall app manually.

### The CallKit VOIP app experience

By implementing the new CallKit APIs in the MonkeyCall app, the user's experience with an incoming VOIP call can be greatly improved in iOS 10. Take the example of the user receiving a VOIP call when their phone is locked from above. By implementing CallKit, the call will appear on the iPhone's Lock screen, just as it would if the call was being received from the built-in Phone app, with the full-screen, native UI and standard swipe-to-answer functionality.

Again, if the iPhone is unlocked when a MonkeyCall VOIP call is received, the same full-screen, native UI and standard swipe-to-answer and tap-to-decline functionality of the built-in Phone app is presented and MonkeyCall has the option of playing a custom ringtone.

CallKit provides additional functionality to MonkeyCall, allowing its VOIP calls to interact with other types of calls, to appear in the built in Recents and Favorite lists, to use the built-in Do Not Disturb and Block features, start MonkeyCall calls from Siri and offers the ability for users to assign MonkeyCall calls to people in the Contacts app.

The following sections will cover the CallKit architecture, the incoming and outgoing call flows and the CallKit API in detail.

## The CallKit architecture

In iOS 10, Apple has adopted CallKit in all of the System Services such that calls made on CarPlay, for example, are known to the System UI via CallKit. In the example given below, since MonkeyCall adopts CallKit, it is known to the System in the same way as these built-in System Services and gets all of the same features:

[![](callkit-images/callkit01.png "The CallKit Service Stack")](callkit-images/callkit01.png#lightbox)

Take a closer look at the MonkeyCall App from the diagram above. The app contains all of its code to communicate with its own network and contains its own User Interfaces. It links in CallKit to communicate with the system:

[![](callkit-images/callkit02.png "MonkeyCall App Architecture")](callkit-images/callkit02.png#lightbox)

There are two main interfaces in CallKit that the app uses:

- `CXProvider` - This allows the MonkeyCall app to inform the system of any out-of-band notifications that might occur.
- `CXCallController` - Allows the MonkeyCall app to inform the system of local user actions.

### The CXProvider

As stated above, `CXProvider` allows an app to inform the system of any out-of-band notifications that might occur. These are notification that do not occur due to local user actions, but occur due to external events such as incoming calls.

An app should use the `CXProvider` for the following:

- Report an incoming call to the System.
- Report an that outgoing call has connected to the System.
- Report the remote user ending the call to the System.

When the app wants to communicate to the system, it uses the `CXCallUpdate` class and when the System needs to communicate with the app, it uses the `CXAction` class:

[![](callkit-images/callkit03.png "Communicating with the system via a CXProvider")](callkit-images/callkit03.png#lightbox)

### The CXCallController

The `CXCallController` allows an app to inform the system of local user actions such as the user starting a VOIP call. By implementing a `CXCallController` the app gets to interplay with other types of calls in the system. For example, if there is already an active telephony call in progress, `CXCallController` can allow the VOIP app to place that call on hold and start or answer a VOIP call.

An app should use the `CXCallController` for the following:

- Report when the user has started an outgoing call to the System.
- Report when the user answers an incoming call to the System.
- Report when the user ends a call to the System.

When the app wants to communicate local user actions to the system, it uses the `CXTransaction` class:

[![](callkit-images/callkit04.png "Reporting to the system using a CXCallController")](callkit-images/callkit04.png#lightbox)

## Implementing CallKit

The following sections will show how to implement CallKit in a Xamarin.iOS VOIP app. For the sake of example, this document will be using code from the fictitious MonkeyCall VOIP app. The code presented here represents several supporting classes, the CallKit specific parts will covered in detail in the following sections.

### The ActiveCall class

The `ActiveCall` class is used by the MonkeyCall app to hold all of the information about a VOIP call that is currently active as follows:

```csharp
using System;
using CoreFoundation;
using Foundation;

namespace MonkeyCall
{
	public class ActiveCall
	{
		#region Private Variables
		private bool isConnecting;
		private bool isConnected;
		private bool isOnhold;
		#endregion

		#region Computed Properties
		public NSUuid UUID { get; set; }
		public bool isOutgoing { get; set; }
		public string Handle { get; set; }
		public DateTime StartedConnectingOn { get; set;}
		public DateTime ConnectedOn { get; set;}
		public DateTime EndedOn { get; set; }

		public bool IsConnecting {
			get { return isConnecting; }
			set {
				isConnecting = value;
				if (isConnecting) StartedConnectingOn = DateTime.Now;
				RaiseStartingConnectionChanged ();
			}
		}

		public bool IsConnected {
			get { return isConnected; }
			set {
				isConnected = value;
				if (isConnected) {
					ConnectedOn = DateTime.Now;
				} else {
					EndedOn = DateTime.Now;
				}
				RaiseConnectedChanged ();
			}
		}

		public bool IsOnHold {
			get { return isOnhold; }
			set {
				isOnhold = value;
			}
		}
		#endregion

		#region Constructors
		public ActiveCall ()
		{
		}

		public ActiveCall (NSUuid uuid, string handle, bool outgoing)
		{
			// Initialize
			this.UUID = uuid;
			this.Handle = handle;
			this.isOutgoing = outgoing;
		}
		#endregion

		#region Public Methods
		public void StartCall (ActiveCallbackDelegate completionHandler)
		{
			// Simulate the call starting successfully
			completionHandler (true);

			// Simulate making a starting and completing a connection
			DispatchQueue.MainQueue.DispatchAfter (new DispatchTime(DispatchTime.Now, 3000), () => {
				// Note that the call is starting
				IsConnecting = true;

				// Simulate pause before connecting
				DispatchQueue.MainQueue.DispatchAfter (new DispatchTime (DispatchTime.Now, 1500), () => {
					// Note that the call has connected
					IsConnecting = false;
					IsConnected = true;
				});
			});
		}

		public void AnswerCall (ActiveCallbackDelegate completionHandler)
		{
			// Simulate the call being answered
			IsConnected = true;
			completionHandler (true);
		}

		public void EndCall (ActiveCallbackDelegate completionHandler)
		{
			// Simulate the call ending
			IsConnected = false;
			completionHandler (true);
		}
		#endregion

		#region Events
		public delegate void ActiveCallbackDelegate (bool successful);
		public delegate void ActiveCallStateChangedDelegate (ActiveCall call);

		public event ActiveCallStateChangedDelegate StartingConnectionChanged;
		internal void RaiseStartingConnectionChanged ()
		{
			if (this.StartingConnectionChanged != null) this.StartingConnectionChanged (this);
		}

		public event ActiveCallStateChangedDelegate ConnectedChanged;
		internal void RaiseConnectedChanged ()
		{
			if (this.ConnectedChanged != null) this.ConnectedChanged (this);
		}
		#endregion
	}
}
```

`ActiveCall` holds several properties that define the state of the call and two events that can be raised when the call state changes. Since this is an example only, there are three methods used to simulated starting, answering and ending a call.

### The StartCallRequest class

The `StartCallRequest` static class, provides a few helper methods that will be used when working with outgoing calls:

```csharp
using System;
using Foundation;
using Intents;

namespace MonkeyCall
{
	public static class StartCallRequest
	{
		public static string URLScheme {
			get { return "monkeycall"; }
		}

		public static string ActivityType {
			get { return INIntentIdentifier.StartAudioCall.GetConstant ().ToString (); }
		}

		public static string CallHandleFromURL (NSUrl url)
		{
			// Is this a MonkeyCall handle?
			if (url.Scheme == URLScheme) {
				// Yes, return host
				return url.Host;
			} else {
				// Not handled
				return null;
			}
		}

		public static string CallHandleFromActivity (NSUserActivity activity)
		{
			// Is this a start call activity?
			if (activity.ActivityType == ActivityType) {
				// Yes, trap any errors
				try {
					// Get first contact
					var interaction = activity.GetInteraction ();
					var startAudioCallIntent = interaction.Intent as INStartAudioCallIntent;
					var contact = startAudioCallIntent.Contacts [0];

					// Get the person handle
					return contact.PersonHandle.Value;
				} catch {
					// Error, report null
					return null;
				}
			} else {
				// Not handled
				return null;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The `CallHandleFromURL` and `CallHandleFromActivity` classes are used in the AppDelegate to get the contact handle of the person being called in an outgoing call. For more information, please see the [Handling Outgoing Calls](#Handling-Outgoing-Calls) section below.

### The ActiveCallManager class

The `ActiveCallManager` class handles all open calls in the MonkeyCall app.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Foundation;
using CallKit;

namespace MonkeyCall
{
	public class ActiveCallManager
	{
		#region Private Variables
		private CXCallController CallController = new CXCallController ();
		#endregion

		#region Computed Properties
		public List<ActiveCall> Calls { get; set; }
		#endregion

		#region Constructors
		public ActiveCallManager ()
		{
			// Initialize
			this.Calls = new List<ActiveCall> ();
		}
		#endregion

		#region Private Methods
		private void SendTransactionRequest (CXTransaction transaction)
		{
			// Send request to call controller
			CallController.RequestTransaction (transaction, (error) => {
				// Was there an error?
				if (error == null) {
					// No, report success
					Console.WriteLine ("Transaction request sent successfully.");
				} else {
					// Yes, report error
					Console.WriteLine ("Error requesting transaction: {0}", error);
				}
			});
		}
		#endregion

		#region Public Methods
		public ActiveCall FindCall (NSUuid uuid)
		{
			// Scan for requested call
			foreach (ActiveCall call in Calls) {
				if (call.UUID.Equals(uuid)) return call;
			}

			// Not found
			return null;
		}

		public void StartCall (string contact)
		{
			// Build call action
			var handle = new CXHandle (CXHandleType.Generic, contact);
			var startCallAction = new CXStartCallAction (new NSUuid (), handle);

			// Create transaction
			var transaction = new CXTransaction (startCallAction);

			// Inform system of call request
			SendTransactionRequest (transaction);
		}

		public void EndCall (ActiveCall call)
		{
			// Build action
			var endCallAction = new CXEndCallAction (call.UUID);

			// Create transaction
			var transaction = new CXTransaction (endCallAction);

			// Inform system of call request
			SendTransactionRequest (transaction);
		}

		public void PlaceCallOnHold (ActiveCall call)
		{
			// Build action
			var holdCallAction = new CXSetHeldCallAction (call.UUID, true);

			// Create transaction
			var transaction = new CXTransaction (holdCallAction);

			// Inform system of call request
			SendTransactionRequest (transaction);
		}

		public void RemoveCallFromOnHold (ActiveCall call)
		{
			// Build action
			var holdCallAction = new CXSetHeldCallAction (call.UUID, false);

			// Create transaction
			var transaction = new CXTransaction (holdCallAction);

			// Inform system of call request
			SendTransactionRequest (transaction);
		}
		#endregion
	}
}
```

Again, since this is a simulation only, the `ActiveCallManager` only maintains a collection of `ActiveCall` objects and has a routine for finding a given call by its `UUID` property. It also includes methods to start, end and change the on-hold state of an outgoing call. For more information, please see the [Handling Outgoing Calls](#Handling-Outgoing-Calls) section below.

### The ProviderDelegate class

As discussed above, a `CXProvider` provides two-way communication between the app and the System for out-of-band notifications. The developer needs to provide a custom `CXProviderDelegate` and attach it to the `CXProvider` for the app to handle out-of-band CallKit events. MonkeyCall uses the following `CXProviderDelegate`:

```csharp
using System;
using Foundation;
using CallKit;
using UIKit;

namespace MonkeyCall
{
	public class ProviderDelegate : CXProviderDelegate
	{
		#region Computed Properties
		public ActiveCallManager CallManager { get; set;}
		public CXProviderConfiguration Configuration { get; set; }
		public CXProvider Provider { get; set; }
		#endregion

		#region Constructors
		public ProviderDelegate (ActiveCallManager callManager)
		{
			// Save connection to call manager
			CallManager = callManager;

			// Define handle types
			var handleTypes = new [] { (NSNumber)(int)CXHandleType.PhoneNumber };

			// Get Image Template
			var templateImage = UIImage.FromFile ("telephone_receiver.png");

			// Setup the initial configurations
			Configuration = new CXProviderConfiguration ("MonkeyCall") {
				MaximumCallsPerCallGroup = 1,
				SupportedHandleTypes = new NSSet<NSNumber> (handleTypes),
				IconTemplateImageData = templateImage.AsPNG(),
				RingtoneSound = "musicloop01.wav"
			};

			// Create a new provider
			Provider = new CXProvider (Configuration);

			// Attach this delegate
			Provider.SetDelegate (this, null);

		}
		#endregion

		#region Override Methods
		public override void DidReset (CXProvider provider)
		{
			// Remove all calls
			CallManager.Calls.Clear ();
		}

		public override void PerformStartCallAction (CXProvider provider, CXStartCallAction action)
		{
			// Create new call record
			var activeCall = new ActiveCall (action.CallUuid, action.CallHandle.Value, true);

			// Monitor state changes
			activeCall.StartingConnectionChanged += (call) => {
				if (call.isConnecting) {
					// Inform system that the call is starting
					Provider.ReportConnectingOutgoingCall (call.UUID, call.StartedConnectingOn.ToNSDate());
				}
			};

			activeCall.ConnectedChanged += (call) => {
				if (call.isConnected) {
					// Inform system that the call has connected
					provider.ReportConnectedOutgoingCall (call.UUID, call.ConnectedOn.ToNSDate ());
				}
			};

			// Start call
			activeCall.StartCall ((successful) => {
				// Was the call able to be started?
				if (successful) {
					// Yes, inform the system
					action.Fulfill ();

					// Add call to manager
					CallManager.Calls.Add (activeCall);
				} else {
					// No, inform system
					action.Fail ();
				}
			});
		}

		public override void PerformAnswerCallAction (CXProvider provider, CXAnswerCallAction action)
		{
			// Find requested call
			var call = CallManager.FindCall (action.CallUuid);

			// Found?
			if (call == null) {
				// No, inform system and exit
				action.Fail ();
				return;
			}

			// Attempt to answer call
			call.AnswerCall ((successful) => {
				// Was the call successfully answered?
				if (successful) {
					// Yes, inform system
					action.Fulfill ();
				} else {
					// No, inform system
					action.Fail ();
				}
			});
		}

		public override void PerformEndCallAction (CXProvider provider, CXEndCallAction action)
		{
			// Find requested call
			var call = CallManager.FindCall (action.CallUuid);

			// Found?
			if (call == null) {
				// No, inform system and exit
				action.Fail ();
				return;
			}

			// Attempt to answer call
			call.EndCall ((successful) => {
				// Was the call successfully answered?
				if (successful) {
					// Remove call from manager's queue
					CallManager.Calls.Remove (call);

					// Yes, inform system
					action.Fulfill ();
				} else {
					// No, inform system
					action.Fail ();
				}
			});
		}

		public override void PerformSetHeldCallAction (CXProvider provider, CXSetHeldCallAction action)
		{
			// Find requested call
			var call = CallManager.FindCall (action.CallUuid);

			// Found?
			if (call == null) {
				// No, inform system and exit
				action.Fail ();
				return;
			}

			// Update hold status
			call.isOnHold = action.OnHold;

			// Inform system of success
			action.Fulfill ();
		}

		public override void TimedOutPerformingAction (CXProvider provider, CXAction action)
		{
			// Inform user that the action has timed out
		}

		public override void DidActivateAudioSession (CXProvider provider, AVFoundation.AVAudioSession audioSession)
		{
			// Start the calls audio session here
		}

		public override void DidDeactivateAudioSession (CXProvider provider, AVFoundation.AVAudioSession audioSession)
		{
			// End the calls audio session and restart any non-call
			// related audio
		}
		#endregion

		#region Public Methods
		public void ReportIncomingCall (NSUuid uuid, string handle)
		{
			// Create update to describe the incoming call and caller
			var update = new CXCallUpdate ();
			update.RemoteHandle = new CXHandle (CXHandleType.Generic, handle);

			// Report incoming call to system
			Provider.ReportNewIncomingCall (uuid, update, (error) => {
				// Was the call accepted
				if (error == null) {
					// Yes, report to call manager
					CallManager.Calls.Add (new ActiveCall (uuid, handle, false));
				} else {
					// Report error to user here
					Console.WriteLine ("Error: {0}", error);
				}
			});
		}
		#endregion
	}
}
```

When an instance of this delegate is created, it's passed the `ActiveCallManager` that it will use to handle any call activity. Next, it defines the handle types (`CXHandleType`) that the `CXProvider` will respond to:

```csharp
// Define handle types
var handleTypes = new [] { (NSNumber)(int)CXHandleType.PhoneNumber };
```

And it gets the template image that will be applied to the app's icon when a call is in progress:

```csharp
// Get Image Template
var templateImage = UIImage.FromFile ("telephone_receiver.png");
```

These values get bundled into a `CXProviderConfiguration` that will be used to configure the `CXProvider`:

```csharp
// Setup the initial configurations
Configuration = new CXProviderConfiguration ("MonkeyCall") {
	MaximumCallsPerCallGroup = 1,
	SupportedHandleTypes = new NSSet<NSNumber> (handleTypes),
	IconTemplateImageData = templateImage.AsPNG(),
	RingtoneSound = "musicloop01.wav"
};
```

The delegate then creates a new `CXProvider` with these configurations and attaches itself to it:

```csharp
// Create a new provider
Provider = new CXProvider (Configuration);

// Attach this delegate
Provider.SetDelegate (this, null);
```

When using CallKit, the app will no longer create and handle its own audio sessions, instead it will need to configure and use an audio session that the System will create and handle for it. 

If this were a real app, the `DidActivateAudioSession` method would be used to start the call with a pre-configured `AVAudioSession` that the System provided:

```csharp
public override void DidActivateAudioSession (CXProvider provider, AVFoundation.AVAudioSession audioSession)
{
	// Start the call's audio session here...
}
```

It would also use the `DidDeactivateAudioSession` method to finalize and release its connection to the System provided audio session:

```csharp
public override void DidDeactivateAudioSession (CXProvider provider, AVFoundation.AVAudioSession audioSession)
{
	// End the calls audio session and restart any non-call
	// releated audio
}
```

The rest of the code will be covered in detail in the sections that follow.

### The AppDelegate class

MonkeyCall uses the AppDelegate to hold instances of the `ActiveCallManager` and `CXProviderDelegate` that will be used throughout the app:

```csharp
using Foundation;
using UIKit;
using Intents;
using System;

namespace MonkeyCall
{
	[Register ("AppDelegate")]
	public class AppDelegate : UIApplicationDelegate
	{
		#region Constructors
		public override UIWindow Window { get; set; }
		public ActiveCallManager CallManager { get; set; }
		public ProviderDelegate CallProviderDelegate { get; set; }
		#endregion

		#region Override Methods
		public override bool FinishedLaunching (UIApplication application, NSDictionary launchOptions)
		{
			// Initialize the call handlers
			CallManager = new ActiveCallManager ();
			CallProviderDelegate = new ProviderDelegate (CallManager);

			return true;
		}

		public override bool OpenUrl (UIApplication app, NSUrl url, NSDictionary options)
		{
			// Get handle from url
			var handle = StartCallRequest.CallHandleFromURL (url);

			// Found?
			if (handle == null) {
				// No, report to system
				Console.WriteLine ("Unable to get call handle from URL: {0}", url); 
				return false;
			} else {
				// Yes, start call and inform system
				CallManager.StartCall (handle);
				return true;
			}
		}

		public override bool ContinueUserActivity (UIApplication application, NSUserActivity userActivity, UIApplicationRestorationHandler completionHandler)
		{
			var handle = StartCallRequest.CallHandleFromActivity (userActivity);

			// Found?
			if (handle == null) {
				// No, report to system
				Console.WriteLine ("Unable to get call handle from User Activity: {0}", userActivity);
				return false;
			} else {
				// Yes, start call and inform system
				CallManager.StartCall (handle);
				return true;
			}
		}

		...
		#endregion
	}
}
```

The `OpenUrl` and `ContinueUserActivity` override methods are used when the app is processing an outgoing call. For more information, please see the [Handling Outgoing Calls](#Handling-Outgoing-Calls) section below.

## Handling incoming calls

There are several states and processes that an incoming VOIP call can go through during a typical incoming call workflow such as:

- Informing the user (and the System) that an incoming call exists.
- Receiving notification when the user wants to answer the call and initializing the call with the other user.
- Inform the System and the Communication Network when the user wants to end the current call.

The following sections will take a detailed look at how an app can use CallKit to handle the incoming call workflow, again using the MonkeyCall VOIP app as an example.

### Informing user of incoming call

When a remote user has started a VOIP conversation with the local user, the following occurs:

[![](callkit-images/callkit05.png "A remote user has started a VOIP conversation")](callkit-images/callkit05.png#lightbox)

1. The app gets a notification from its Communications Network that there is an incoming VOIP call.
2. The app uses the `CXProvider` to send a `CXCallUpdate` to the System informing it of the call.
3. The System publishes the call to the System UI, System Services and any other VOIP apps using CallKit.

For example, in the `CXProviderDelegate`:

```csharp
public void ReportIncomingCall (NSUuid uuid, string handle)
{
	// Create update to describe the incoming call and caller
	var update = new CXCallUpdate ();
	update.RemoteHandle = new CXHandle (CXHandleType.Generic, handle);

	// Report incoming call to system
	Provider.ReportNewIncomingCall (uuid, update, (error) => {
		// Was the call accepted
		if (error == null) {
			// Yes, report to call manager
			CallManager.Calls.Add (new ActiveCall (uuid, handle, false));
		} else {
			// Report error to user here
			Console.WriteLine ("Error: {0}", error);
		}
	});
}
```

This code creates a new `CXCallUpdate` instance and attaches a handle to it that will identify the caller. Next, it uses the `ReportNewIncomingCall` method of the `CXProvider` class to inform the system of the call. If it is successful, the call is added to the app's collection of active calls, if it isn't, the error needs to be reported to the user.

### User answering incoming call

If the user wants to answer the incoming VOIP call, the following occurs:

[![](callkit-images/callkit06.png "The user answers the incoming VOIP call")](callkit-images/callkit06.png#lightbox)

1. The System UI informs the System that the user wants to answer the VOIP call.
2. The System sends a `CXAnswerCallAction` to the app's `CXProvider` informing it of the Answer Intent.
3. The app informs its Communication Network that the user is answering the call and the VOIP call proceeds as usual.

For example, in the `CXProviderDelegate`:

```csharp
public override void PerformAnswerCallAction (CXProvider provider, CXAnswerCallAction action)
{
	// Find requested call
	var call = CallManager.FindCall (action.CallUuid);

	// Found?
	if (call == null) {
		// No, inform system and exit
		action.Fail ();
		return;
	}

	// Attempt to answer call
	call.AnswerCall ((successful) => {
		// Was the call successfully answered?
		if (successful) {
			// Yes, inform system
			action.Fulfill ();
		} else {
			// No, inform system
			action.Fail ();
		}
	});
}
```

This code first searches for the given call in its list of active calls. If the call can't be found, the system is notified and the method exits. If it is found, the `AnswerCall` method of the `ActiveCall` class is called to start the call and the System is information if it succeeds or fails.

### User ending incoming call

If the user wishes to terminate the call from within the app's UI, the following occurs:

[![](callkit-images/callkit07.png "The user terminates the call from within the app's UI")](callkit-images/callkit07.png#lightbox)

1. The app creates `CXEndCallAction` that gets bundled into a `CXTransaction` that is sent to the System to inform it that the call is ending.
2. The System verifies the End Call Intent and sends the `CXEndCallAction` back to the app via the `CXProvider`.
3. The app then informs its Communication Network that the call is ending.

For example, in the `CXProviderDelegate`:

```csharp
public override void PerformEndCallAction (CXProvider provider, CXEndCallAction action)
{
	// Find requested call
	var call = CallManager.FindCall (action.CallUuid);

	// Found?
	if (call == null) {
		// No, inform system and exit
		action.Fail ();
		return;
	}

	// Attempt to answer call
	call.EndCall ((successful) => {
		// Was the call successfully answered?
		if (successful) {
			// Remove call from manager's queue
			CallManager.Calls.Remove (call);

			// Yes, inform system
			action.Fulfill ();
		} else {
			// No, inform system
			action.Fail ();
		}
	});
}
```

This code first searches for the given call in its list of active calls. If the call can't be found, the system is notified and the method exits. If it is found, the `EndCall` method of the `ActiveCall` class is called to end the call and the System is information if it succeeds or fails. If successful, the call is removed from the collection of active calls.

## Managing multiple calls

Most VOIP apps can handle multiple calls at once. For example, if there is currently an active VOIP call and the app gets notification that a there is a new incoming call, the user can pause or hang-up on the first call to answer the second one.

In the situation give above, the System will send a `CXTransaction` to the app that will include a list of multiple actions (such as the `CXEndCallAction` and the `CXAnswerCallAction`). All of these actions will need to be fulfilled individually, so that the System can update the UI appropriately.

## Handling outgoing calls

If the user taps an entry from the Recents list (in the Phone app), for example, that is from a call belonging to the app, it will be sent a _Start Call Intent_ by the system:

[![](callkit-images/callkit08.png "Receiving a Start Call Intent")](callkit-images/callkit08.png#lightbox)

1. The app will create a _Start Call Action_ based on the Start Call Intent that it received from the System. 
2. The app will use the `CXCallController` to request the Start Call Action from the system.
3. If the System accepts the Action, it will be returned to the app via the `XCProvider` delegate.
4. The app starts the outgoing call with its Communication Network.

For more information on Intents, please see our [Intents and Intents UI Extensions](~/ios/platform/sirikit/understanding-sirikit.md) documentation. 

### The outgoing call lifecycle

When working with CallKit and an outgoing call, the app will need to inform the System of the following lifecycle events:

1. **Starting** - Inform the system that an outgoing call is about to start.
2. **Started** - Inform the system that an outgoing call has started.
3. **Connecting** - Inform the system that the outgoing call is connecting.
4. **Connected** - Inform the outgoing call has connected and that both parties can talk now.

For example, the following code will start an outgoing call:

```csharp
private CXCallController CallController = new CXCallController ();
...

private void SendTransactionRequest (CXTransaction transaction)
{
	// Send request to call controller
	CallController.RequestTransaction (transaction, (error) => {
		// Was there an error?
		if (error == null) {
			// No, report success
			Console.WriteLine ("Transaction request sent successfully.");
		} else {
			// Yes, report error
			Console.WriteLine ("Error requesting transaction: {0}", error);
		}
	});
}

public void StartCall (string contact)
{
	// Build call action
	var handle = new CXHandle (CXHandleType.Generic, contact);
	var startCallAction = new CXStartCallAction (new NSUuid (), handle);

	// Create transaction
	var transaction = new CXTransaction (startCallAction);

	// Inform system of call request
	SendTransactionRequest (transaction);
}
```

It creates a `CXHandle` and uses it to configure a `CXStartCallAction` which is bundled into a `CXTransaction` that is sent to the System using the `RequestTransaction` method of the `CXCallController` class. By calling the `RequestTransaction` method, the System can place any existing calls on-hold, no matter the source (Phone app, FaceTime, VOIP, etc.), before the new call starts.

The request to start an outgoing VOIP call can come from several different sources, such as Siri, an entry on a Contact card (in the Contacts app) or from the Recents list (in the Phone app). In these situations, the app will be sent a Start Call Intent inside a `NSUserActivity` and the AppDelegate will need to handle it:

```csharp
public override bool ContinueUserActivity (UIApplication application, NSUserActivity userActivity, UIApplicationRestorationHandler completionHandler)
{
	var handle = StartCallRequest.CallHandleFromActivity (userActivity);

	// Found?
	if (handle == null) {
		// No, report to system
		Console.WriteLine ("Unable to get call handle from User Activity: {0}", userActivity);
		return false;
	} else {
		// Yes, start call and inform system
		CallManager.StartCall (handle);
		return true;
	}
}
```

Here the `CallHandleFromActivity` method of the helper class `StartCallRequest` is being used to get the handle to the person being called (see [The StartCallRequest Class](#The-StartCallRequest-Class) above). 

The `PerformStartCallAction` method of the [ProviderDelegate Class](#The-ProviderDelegate-Class) is used to finally start the actual outgoing call and inform the System of its lifecycle:

```csharp
public override void PerformStartCallAction (CXProvider provider, CXStartCallAction action)
{
	// Create new call record
	var activeCall = new ActiveCall (action.CallUuid, action.CallHandle.Value, true);

	// Monitor state changes
	activeCall.StartingConnectionChanged += (call) => {
		if (call.IsConnecting) {
			// Inform system that the call is starting
			Provider.ReportConnectingOutgoingCall (call.UUID, call.StartedConnectingOn.ToNSDate());
		}
	};

	activeCall.ConnectedChanged += (call) => {
		if (call.IsConnected) {
			// Inform system that the call has connected
			Provider.ReportConnectedOutgoingCall (call.UUID, call.ConnectedOn.ToNSDate ());
		}
	};

	// Start call
	activeCall.StartCall ((successful) => {
		// Was the call able to be started?
		if (successful) {
			// Yes, inform the system
			action.Fulfill ();

			// Add call to manager
			CallManager.Calls.Add (activeCall);
		} else {
			// No, inform system
			action.Fail ();
		}
	});
}
```

It creates an instance of the `ActiveCall` class (to hold information about the call in progress) and populates with the person being called. The `StartingConnectionChanged` and `ConnectedChanged` events are used to monitor and report the outgoing call lifecycle. The call is started and the System informed that the Action was fulfilled.

### Ending an outgoing call

When the user has finished with an outgoing call and wishes to end it, the following code can be used:

```csharp
private CXCallController CallController = new CXCallController ();
...

private void SendTransactionRequest (CXTransaction transaction)
{
	// Send request to call controller
	CallController.RequestTransaction (transaction, (error) => {
		// Was there an error?
		if (error == null) {
			// No, report success
			Console.WriteLine ("Transaction request sent successfully.");
		} else {
			// Yes, report error
			Console.WriteLine ("Error requesting transaction: {0}", error);
		}
	});
}

public void EndCall (ActiveCall call)
{
	// Build action
	var endCallAction = new CXEndCallAction (call.UUID);

	// Create transaction
	var transaction = new CXTransaction (endCallAction);

	// Inform system of call request
	SendTransactionRequest (transaction);
}
```

If creates a `CXEndCallAction` with the UUID of the call to end, bundles it in a `CXTransaction` that is sent to the System using the `RequestTransaction` method of the `CXCallController` class. 

## Additional CallKit details

This section will cover some additional details that the developer will need to take into consideration when working with CallKit such as:

- Provider Configuration
- Action Errors
- System Restrictions
- VOIP Audio

### Provider configuration

The provider configuration allows an iOS 10 VOIP app to customize the user experience (inside the native In-Call UI) when working with CallKit.

An app can make the following types of customizations:

- Display a localized name.
- Enable video call support.
- Customize the buttons on the In-Call UI by presenting its own template image icon. User interaction with custom buttons is sent directly to the app to be processed. 

### Action errors

iOS 10 VOIP apps using CallKit need to handle Actions failing gracefully and keep the user informed of the Action state at all times. 

Take the following example into consideration:

1. The app has received a Start Call Action and has begun the process of initializing a new VOIP call with its Communication Network.
2. Because of limited or no network communication capability, this connection fails.
3. The app *must* send the **Fail** message back to the Start Call Action (`Action.Fail()`) to inform the System of the failure.
4. This allows the System to inform the user of the status of the call. For example, to display the Call Failure UI.

Additionally, an iOS 10 VOIP app will need to respond to _Timeout Errors_ that can occur when an expected Action cannot be processed within a given amount of time. Each Action Type provided by CallKit has a maximum Timeout value associated with it. These Timeout values ensure that any CallKit Action requested by the user is handled in a responsive fashion, thus keeping the OS fluid and responsive as well.

There are several methods on the Provider Delegate (`CXProviderDelegate`) that should be overridden to gracefully handle this Timeout situations as well.

### System restrictions

Based on the current state of the iOS device running the iOS 10 VOIP app, certain system restrictions may be enforced.

For example, an incoming VOIP call can be restricted by the System if:

1. The person calling is on the user's Blocked Caller List.
2. The user's iOS device is in the Do-Not-Disturb mode.

If a VOIP call is restricted by any of these situations, use the following code to handle it:

```csharp
public class ProviderDelegate : CXProviderDelegate
{
...

	public void ReportIncomingCall (NSUuid uuid, string handle)
	{
		// Create update to describe the incoming call and caller
		var update = new CXCallUpdate ();
		update.RemoteHandle = new CXHandle (CXHandleType.Generic, handle);
	
		// Report incoming call to system
		Provider.ReportNewIncomingCall (uuid, update, (error) => {
			// Was the call accepted
			if (error == null) {
				// Yes, report to call manager
				CallManager.Calls.Add (new ActiveCall (uuid, handle, false));
			} else {
				// Report error to user here
				if (error.Code == (int)CXErrorCodeIncomingCallError.CallUuidAlreadyExists) {
					// Handle duplicate call ID
				} else if (error.Code == (int)CXErrorCodeIncomingCallError.FilteredByBlockList) {
					// Handle call from blocked user
				} else if (error.Code == (int)CXErrorCodeIncomingCallError.FilteredByDoNotDisturb) {
					// Handle call while in do-not-disturb mode
				} else {
					// Handle unknown error
				}
			}
		});
	}

}
```

### VOIP audio

CallKit provides several benefits for handling the audio resources that an iOS 10 VOIP app will require during a live VOIP call. One of the biggest benefits is the app's audio session will have elevated priorities when running in iOS 10. This is the same priority level as the built in Phone and FaceTime apps and this enhanced priority level will prevent other running apps from interrupting the VOIP app's audio session.

Additionally, CallKit has access to other audio routing hints that can enhance the performance and intelligently route VOIP audio to specific output devices during a live call based on user preferences and device states. For example, based on attached devices such as bluetooth headphones, a live CarPlay connection or Accessibility settings.

During the lifecycle of a typical VOIP call using CallKit, the app will need to configure the Audio Stream that CallKit will provide it. Take a look at the following example:

[![](callkit-images/callkit09.png "The Start Call Action Sequence")](callkit-images/callkit09.png#lightbox)

1. A Start Call Action is received by the app to answer an incoming call.
2. Before this Action is fulfilled by the app, it provides the configuration that is will require for its `AVAudioSession`.
3. The app informs the System that the Action has been fulfilled.
4. Before the call connects, CallKit provides a high-priority `AVAudioSession` matching the configuration that the app requested. The app will be notified via the `DidActivateAudioSession` method of its `CXProviderDelegate`.

## Working with call directory extensions

When working with CallKit, _Call Directory Extensions_ provide a way to add blocked call numbers and identify numbers that are specific to a given VOIP app to contacts in the Contact app on the iOS device.

### Implementing a Call directory extension

To implement a Call Directory Extension in a Xamarin.iOS app, do the following:

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/macos)

1. Open the app's solution in Visual Studio for Mac.
2. Right-click on the Solution Name in the **Solution Explorer** and select **Add** > **Add New Project**.
3. Select **iOS** > **Extensions** > **Call Directory Extensions** and click the **Next** button: 

	[![](callkit-images/calldir01.png "Creating a new Call Directory Extension")](callkit-images/calldir01.png#lightbox)
4. Enter a **Name** for the extension and click the **Next** button: 

	[![](callkit-images/calldir02.png "Entering a name for the extension")](callkit-images/calldir02.png#lightbox)
5. Adjust the **Project Name** and/or **Solution Name** if required and click the **Create** button: 

	[![](callkit-images/calldir03.png "Creating the project")](callkit-images/calldir03.png#lightbox) 

# [Visual Studio](#tab/windows)

1. Open the app's solution in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click on the Solution Name in the **Solution Explorer** and select **Add** > **Add New Project**.
3. Select **iOS** > **Extensions** > **Call Directory Extensions** and click the **Next** button: 

	[![](callkit-images/calldir01w.png "Creating a new Call Directory Extension")](callkit-images/calldir01.png#lightbox)
4. Enter a **Name** for the extension and click the **OK** button

-----

This will add a `CallDirectoryHandler.cs` class to the project that looks like the following:

```csharp
using System;

using Foundation;
using CallKit;

namespace MonkeyCallDirExtension
{
	[Register ("CallDirectoryHandler")]
	public class CallDirectoryHandler : CXCallDirectoryProvider, ICXCallDirectoryExtensionContextDelegate
	{
		#region Constructors
		protected CallDirectoryHandler (IntPtr handle) : base (handle)
		{
			// Note: this .ctor should not contain any initialization logic.
		}
		#endregion

		#region Override Methods
		public override void BeginRequest (CXCallDirectoryExtensionContext context)
		{
			context.Delegate = this;

			if (!AddBlockingPhoneNumbers (context)) {
				Console.WriteLine ("Unable to add blocking phone numbers");
				var error = new NSError (new NSString ("CallDirectoryHandler"), 1, null);
				context.CancelRequest (error);
				return;
			}

			if (!AddIdentificationPhoneNumbers (context)) {
				Console.WriteLine ("Unable to add identification phone numbers");
				var error = new NSError (new NSString ("CallDirectoryHandler"), 2, null);
				context.CancelRequest (error);
				return;
			}

			context.CompleteRequest (null);
		}
		#endregion

		#region Private Methods
		private bool AddBlockingPhoneNumbers (CXCallDirectoryExtensionContext context)
		{
			// Retrieve phone numbers to block from data store. For optimal performance and memory usage when there are many phone numbers,
			// consider only loading a subset of numbers at a given time and using autorelease pool(s) to release objects allocated during each batch of numbers which are loaded.
			//
			// Numbers must be provided in numerically ascending order.

			long [] phoneNumbers = { 14085555555, 18005555555 };

			foreach (var phoneNumber in phoneNumbers)
				context.AddBlockingEntry (phoneNumber);

			return true;
		}

		private bool AddIdentificationPhoneNumbers (CXCallDirectoryExtensionContext context)
		{
			// Retrieve phone numbers to identify and their identification labels from data store. For optimal performance and memory usage when there are many phone numbers,
			// consider only loading a subset of numbers at a given time and using autorelease pool(s) to release objects allocated during each batch of numbers which are loaded.
			//
			// Numbers must be provided in numerically ascending order.

			long [] phoneNumbers = { 18775555555, 18885555555 };
			string [] labels = { "Telemarketer", "Local business" };

			for (var i = 0; i < phoneNumbers.Length; i++) {
				long phoneNumber = phoneNumbers [i];
				string label = labels [i];
				context.AddIdentificationEntry (phoneNumber, label);
			}

			return true;
		}
		#endregion

		#region Public Methods
		public void RequestFailed (CXCallDirectoryExtensionContext extensionContext, NSError error)
		{
			// An error occurred while adding blocking or identification entries, check the NSError for details.
			// For Call Directory error codes, see the CXErrorCodeCallDirectoryManagerError enum.
			//
			// This may be used to store the error details in a location accessible by the extension's containing app, so that the
			// app may be notified about errors which occurred while loading data even if the request to load data was initiated by
			// the user in Settings instead of via the app itself.
		}
		#endregion
	}
}
```

The `BeginRequest` method in the Call Directory Handler will need to be modified to provide the required functionality. In the case of the sample above, it attempts to set the list of blocked and available numbers in the VOIP app's contacts database. If either requests fails for any reason, create an `NSError` to describe the failure and pass it the `CancelRequest` method of the `CXCallDirectoryExtensionContext` class.

To set the blocked numbers use the `AddBlockingEntry` method of the `CXCallDirectoryExtensionContext` class. The numbers provided to the method _must_ be in numerically ascending order. For optimal performance and memory usage when there are many phone numbers, consider only loading a subset of numbers at a given time and using autorelease pool(s) to release objects allocated during each batch of numbers which are loaded.

To inform to Contact app of the contact numbers known to the VOIP app, use the `AddIdentificationEntry` method of the `CXCallDirectoryExtensionContext` class and provide both the number and an identifying label. Again, the numbers provided to the method _must_ be in numerically ascending order. For optimal performance and memory usage when there are many phone numbers, consider only loading a subset of numbers at a given time and using autorelease pool(s) to release objects allocated during each batch of numbers which are loaded.

## Summary

This article has covered the new CallKit API that Apple released in iOS 10 and how to implement it in Xamarin.iOS VOIP apps. It has shown how CallKit allows an app to integrate into the iOS System, how it provides feature parity with built-in apps (such as Phone) and how it increases an app's visibility throughout iOS in locations such as the Lock and Home Screens, via Siri interactions and via the Contacts apps.

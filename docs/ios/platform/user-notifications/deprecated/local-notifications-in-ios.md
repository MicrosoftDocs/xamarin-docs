# Notifications in Xamarin.iOS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this section pertains to iOS 9 and prior. For iOS 10 and later, please see the [User notification framework guide](~/ios/platform/user-notifications/index.md).

iOS has three ways to indicate to the user that a notification has been received:

- **Sound or vibration** - iOS can play a sound to notify users. If the sound is disabled, the device can be configured to vibrate.
- **Alerts** - It is possible to display a dialog on the screen with information about the notification.
- **Badges** - When a notification is published, a number can be displayed (badged) on the application icon.

iOS also provides a *Notification Center* that will display all the notifications, both local and remote, to
the user. Users may access this by swiping down from the top of the screen:

## Creating local notifications in iOS

iOS makes it fairly simple to create and handle local notifications.
First, iOS 8 requires applications to ask for the user's permission
to display notifications. Add the following code to your app before
attempting to send a local notification - the 
[attached sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/ios-samples/localnotifications) 
places it in the **AppDelegate**'s **FinishedLaunching** method.

```csharp
var notificationSettings = UIUserNotificationSettings.GetSettingsForTypes(
    UIUserNotificationType.Alert | UIUserNotificationType.Badge | UIUserNotificationType.Sound, null
);
application.RegisterUserNotificationSettings(notificationSettings);
```

To schedule a local notification, create a `UILocalNotification` object,
set the `FireDate`, and schedule it via the `ScheduleLocalNotification`
method on the `UIApplication.SharedApplication` object. The following
code snippet shows how to schedule a notification that will fire one
minute in the future, and display an alert with a message:

```csharp
UILocalNotification notification = new UILocalNotification();
notification.FireDate = NSDate.FromTimeIntervalSinceNow(15);
//notification.AlertTitle = "Alert Title"; // required for Apple Watch notifications
notification.AlertAction = "View Alert";
notification.AlertBody = "Your 15 second alert has fired!";
UIApplication.SharedApplication.ScheduleLocalNotification(notification);
```

The following screenshot shows what this alert looks like:

Note that if the user chose to *not allow* notifications then nothing
will be displayed.

If you want to apply a badge to the application icon with a number, you
can set it as shown in the following line code:

```csharp
notification.ApplicationIconBadgeNumber = 1;
```

In order play a sound with the icon, set the SoundName property on the notification as shown in the following code snippet:

```csharp
notification.SoundName = UILocalNotification.DefaultSoundName;
```

If the notification sound is longer than 30 seconds, iOS will play the 
default sound instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a bug in the iOS simulator that will fire the delegate notification twice. This issue should not occur when running the application on a device.

## Handling notifications

iOS applications handle remote and local notifications in almost exactly the same fashion. When an application is
running, the `ReceivedLocalNotification` method or the `ReceivedRemoteNotification` method on the `AppDelegate` class will
be called, and the notification information will be passed as a parameter.

An application can handle a notification in different ways. For instance, the application might just display an alert
to remind users about some event. Or the notification might be used to display an alert to the user that a process
has finished, such as synching files to a server.

The following code shows how to handle a local notification and display an alert and reset the badge number to
zero:

```csharp
public override void ReceivedLocalNotification(UIApplication application, UILocalNotification notification)
{
    // show an alert
    UIAlertController okayAlertController = UIAlertController.Create(notification.AlertAction, notification.AlertBody, UIAlertControllerStyle.Alert);
    okayAlertController.AddAction(UIAlertAction.Create("OK", UIAlertActionStyle.Default, null));

    Window.RootViewController.PresentViewController(okayAlertController, true, null);

    // reset our badge
    UIApplication.SharedApplication.ApplicationIconBadgeNumber = 0;
}
```

If the application is not running, iOS will play the sound and/or update the icon badge as applicable. When the user
starts up the application associated with the alert, the application will launch and the `FinishedLaunching` method on
the app delegate will be called and the notification information will be passed in via the `launchOptions` parameter. If the
options dictionary contains the key `UIApplication.LaunchOptionsLocalNotificationKey`, then the `AppDelegate` knows that
the application was launched from a local notification. The following code snippet demonstrates this process:

```csharp
// check for a local notification
if (launchOptions.ContainsKey(UIApplication.LaunchOptionsLocalNotificationKey))
{
    var localNotification = launchOptions[UIApplication.LaunchOptionsLocalNotificationKey] as UILocalNotification;
    if (localNotification != null)
    {
        UIAlertController okayAlertController = UIAlertController.Create(localNotification.AlertAction, localNotification.AlertBody, UIAlertControllerStyle.Alert);
        okayAlertController.AddAction(UIAlertAction.Create("OK", UIAlertActionStyle.Default, null));

        Window.RootViewController.PresentViewController(okayAlertController, true, null);

        // reset our badge
        UIApplication.SharedApplication.ApplicationIconBadgeNumber = 0;
    }
}
```

For a remote notification, `launchOptions` will have a
`LaunchOptionsRemoteNotificationKey` with an associated `NSDictionary`
containing the remote notification payload. You can extract the
notification payload via the `alert`, `badge`, and `sound` keys. The
following code snippet shows how to get remote notifications:

```csharp
NSDictionary remoteNotification = options[UIApplication.LaunchOptionsRemoteNotificationKey];
if(remoteNotification != null)
{
    string alert = remoteNotification["alert"];
}
```

## Summary

This section showed how to create and publish a notification in Xamarin.iOS. It show how an application may react
to notifications by overriding the `ReceivedLocalNotification` method or the `ReceivedRemoteNotification` method in the `AppDelegate`.

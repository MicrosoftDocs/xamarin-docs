# Annotations and Overlays in Xamarin.iOS

The application we’re going to build in this walkthrough is shown below:

 [![](ios-maps-walkthrough-images/00-map-overlay.png "An example MapKit app")](ios-maps-walkthrough-images/00-map-overlay.png#lightbox)

You can find the completed code in the [Maps Walkthrough sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/xamarin/ios-samples/mapswalkthrough).

Let's begin by creating a new **iOS Empty Project**, and giving it a relevant name. We'll start by adding code to our View Controller to display the MapView, and will then create new classes for our MapDelegate, and the custom annotations. Follow the steps below to achieve this:

## ViewController


1. Add the following namespaces to the `ViewController`:

    ```csharp
    using MapKit;
    using CoreLocation;
    using UIKit
    using CoreGraphics
    ```

1. Add an `MKMapView` instance variable to the class, along with a `MapDelegate` instance. We'll create the `MapDelegate` shortly:

    ```csharp
    public partial class ViewController : UIViewController
    {
        MKMapView map;
        MapDelegate mapDelegate;
        ...
    ```

1. In the controller's `LoadView` method, add an `MKMapView` and set it to the `View` property of the controller:

    ```csharp
    public override void LoadView ()
    {
        map = new MKMapView (UIScreen.MainScreen.Bounds);
        View = map;
    }
    ```

    Next, we'll add code to initialize the map in the `ViewDidLoad`` method.

1. In `ViewDidLoad` add code to set the map type, show the user location and allow zooming and panning:

    ```csharp
    // change map type, show user location and allow zooming and panning
    map.MapType = MKMapType.Standard;
    map.ShowsUserLocation = true;
    map.ZoomEnabled = true;
    map.ScrollEnabled = true;

    ```

1. Next, add code to center the map and set it's region:

    ```csharp
    double lat = 30.2652233534254;
    double lon = -97.73815460962083;
    CLLocationCoordinate2D mapCenter = new CLLocationCoordinate2D (lat, lon);
    MKCoordinateRegion mapRegion = MKCoordinateRegion.FromDistance (mapCenter, 100, 100);
    map.CenterCoordinate = mapCenter;
    map.Region = mapRegion;

    ```

1. Create a new instance of  `MapDelegate` and assign it to the `Delegate` of the `MKMapView`. Again, we'll implcodeent the `MapDelegate` shortly:

    ```csharp
    mapDelegate = new MapDelegate ();
    map.Delegate = mapDelegate;
    ```

1. As of iOS 8, you should be requesting authorization from your user to use their location, so let's add this to our sample. First, define a `CLLocationManager` class-level variable:

    ```csharp
    CLLocationManager locationManager = new CLLocationManager();
    ```

1. In the `ViewDidLoad` method, we want to check if the device running the application is using iOS 8, and if it is we will request authorization when the app is in use:

    ```csharp
    if (UIDevice.CurrentDevice.CheckSystemVersion(8,0)){
        locationManager.RequestWhenInUseAuthorization ();
    }
    ```

1. Finally, we need to edit the **Info.plist** file to advise users of the reason for requesting their location. In the **Source** menu of the **Info.plist**, add the following key:

    `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`

    and string:

    `Maps Walkthrough Docs Sample`.


## ConferenceAnnotation.cs – A class for custom Annotations


1. We're going to use a custom class for the annotation called `ConferenceAnnotation`. Add the following class to the project:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using CoreLocation;
    using MapKit;

    namespace MapsWalkthrough
    {
        public class ConferenceAnnotation : MKAnnotation
        {
            string title;
            CLLocationCoordinate2D coord;

            public ConferenceAnnotation (string title,
            CLLocationCoordinate2D coord)
            {
                this.title = title;
                this.coord = coord;
            }

            public override string Title {
                get {
                    return title;
                }
            }

            public override CLLocationCoordinate2D Coordinate {
                get {
                    return coord;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## ViewController - Adding the annotation and overlay

1. With the `ConferenceAnnotation` in place we can add it to the map. Back in the `ViewDidLoad` method of the `ViewController`, add the annotation at the map's center coordinate:

    ```csharp
    map.AddAnnotations (new ConferenceAnnotation ("Evolve Conference", mapCenter));
    ```

1. We also want to have an overlay of the hotel. Add the following code to create the `MKPolygon` using the coordinates for the hotel provided, and add it to the map by call `AddOverlay`:

    ```csharp
    // add an overlay of the hotel
    MKPolygon hotelOverlay = MKPolygon.FromCoordinates(
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D[]{
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D(30.2649977168594, -97.73863627705),
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D(30.2648461170005, -97.7381627734755),
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D(30.2648355402574, -97.7381750192576),
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D(30.2647791309417, -97.7379872505988),
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D(30.2654525150319, -97.7377341711021),
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D(30.2654807195004, -97.7377994819399),
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D(30.2655089239607, -97.7377994819399),
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D(30.2656428950368, -97.738346460207),
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D(30.2650364981811, -97.7385709662122),
        new CLLocationCoordinate2D(30.2650470749025, -97.7386199493406)
    });

    map.AddOverlay (hotelOverlay);
    ```

This completes the code in `ViewDidLoad`. Now we need to implement our `MapDelegate` class to handle creating the annotation and overlay views respectively.


## MapDelegate

1. Create a class called `MapDelegate` that inherits from `MKMapViewDelegate` and include an `annotationId` variable to use as a reuse identifier for the annotation:

    ```csharp
    class MapDelegate : MKMapViewDelegate
    {
        static string annotationId = "ConferenceAnnotation";
        ...
    }
    ```

    We only have one annotation here so the reuse code isn't strictly necessary, but it's a good practice to include it.

1. Implement the `GetViewForAnnotation` method to return a view for the `ConferenceAnnotation` using the **conference.png** image included with this walkthrough:

    ```csharp
    public override MKAnnotationView GetViewForAnnotation (MKMapView mapView, NSObject annotation)
    {
        MKAnnotationView annotationView = null;

        if (annotation is MKUserLocation)
            return null;

        if (annotation is ConferenceAnnotation) {

            // show conference annotation
            annotationView = mapView.DequeueReusableAnnotation (annotationId);

            if (annotationView == null)
                annotationView = new MKAnnotationView (annotation, annotationId);

            annotationView.Image = UIImage.FromFile ("images/conference.png");
            annotationView.CanShowCallout = true;
        }

        return annotationView;
    }
    ```

1. When the user taps on the annotation, we want to display an image showing the city of Austin. Add the following variables to the `MapDelegate` for the image and the view to display it:

    ```csharp
    UIImageView venueView;
    UIImage venueImage;
    ```

1. Next, to show the image when the annotation is tapped, implement the `DidSelectAnnotation` method as follows:

    ```csharp
    public override void DidSelectAnnotationView (MKMapView mapView, MKAnnotationView view)
    {
        // show an image view when the conference annotation view is selected
        if (view.Annotation is ConferenceAnnotation) {

            venueView = new UIImageView ();
            venueView.ContentMode = UIViewContentMode.ScaleAspectFit;
            venueImage = UIImage.FromFile ("image/venue.png");
            venueView.Image = venueImage;
            view.AddSubview (venueView);

            UIView.Animate (0.4, () => {
            venueView.Frame = new CGRect (-75, -75, 200, 200); });
        }
    }
    ```

1. To hide the image when the user deselects the annotation by tapping anywhere else on the map, implement the `DidSelectAnnotationView` method as follows:

    ```csharp
    public override void DidDeselectAnnotationView (MKMapView mapView, MKAnnotationView view)
    {
        // remove the image view when the conference annotation is deselected
        if (view.Annotation is ConferenceAnnotation) {

            venueView.RemoveFromSuperview ();
            venueView.Dispose ();
            venueView = null;
        }
    }
    ```

    We now have the code for the annotation in place. All that is left is to add code to the `MapDelegate` to create the view for the hotel overlay.

1. Add the following implementation of `GetViewForOverlay` to the `MapDelegate`:

    ```csharp
    public override MKOverlayView GetViewForOverlay (MKMapView mapView, NSObject overlay)
    {
        // return a view for the polygon
        MKPolygon polygon = overlay as MKPolygon;
        MKPolygonView polygonView = new MKPolygonView (polygon);
        polygonView.FillColor = UIColor.Blue;
        polygonView.StrokeColor = UIColor.Red;
        return polygonView;
    }
    ```

Run the application. We now have an interactive map with a custom annotation and an overlay! Tap on the annotation and the image of Austin is displayed, as shown below:

## Summary

In this article we looked at how to add an annotation to a map as well as how to add an overlay for a specified polygon. We also demonstrated how to add touch support to the annotation to animate an image over a map.

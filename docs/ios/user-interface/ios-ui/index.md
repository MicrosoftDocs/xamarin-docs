# User Interfaces in iOS

## [Appearance API](introduction-to-the-appearance-api.md)

iOS allows many visual attributes of the user interface controls to be themed using the UIAppearance APIs.

## [Creating User Interface Objects](~/ios/user-interface/ios-ui/creating-ui-objects.md)

Apple groups related pieces of functionality into “frameworks” which equate to Xamarin.iOS namespaces. `UIKit` is the
namespace that contains all the user interface controls for iOS.

## [Layout Options](~/ios/user-interface/ios-ui/layout-options.md)

There are two different mechanisms for controlling the layout when a view is resized or rotated: Autosizing and Autolayout.

## [Providing Haptic Feedback](~/ios/user-interface/ios-ui/haptic-feedback.md)

This article covers the new types of haptic feedback available in iOS 10 and how to implement them in Xamarin.iOS.

## [Working with the UI Thread](~/ios/user-interface/ios-ui/ui-thread.md)

Your code should only make changes to user interface controls from the main (or UI) thread. Any UI updates that occur on a different thread (such as a callback or background thread) may not get rendered to the screen, or could even cause a crash.

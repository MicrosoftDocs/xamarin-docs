# Generic subclasses of NSObject in Xamarin.iOS

## Using generics with NSObjects

It's possible to use generics in
subclasses of `NSObject`, for example [UIView](xref:UIKit.UIView):

```csharp
class Foo<T> : UIView {
    public Foo (CGRect x) : base (x) {}
    public override void Draw (CoreGraphics.CGRect rect)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("T: {0}. Type: {1}", typeof (T), GetType ().Name);
    }
}
```

Since objects that subclass `NSObject` are registered with
the Objective-C runtime there are some limitations as to what
is possible with generic subclasses of `NSObject` types.

## Considerations for generic subclasses of NSObject

This document details the limitations in the limited
support for generic subclasses of `NSObjects`.

### Generic Type Arguments in Member Signatures

All generic type arguments in a member signature exposed to
Objective-C must have an `NSObject` constraint.

**Good**:

```csharp
class Generic<T> : NSObject where T: NSObject
{
    [Export ("myMethod:")]
    public void MyMethod (T value)
    {
    }
}
```

**Reason**: The generic type parameter is an `NSObject`, so
the selector signature for `myMethod:` can be safely exposed
to Objective-C (it will always be `NSObject` or a subclass of
it).

**Bad**:

```csharp
class Generic<T> : NSObject
{
    [Export ("myMethod:")]
    public void MyMethod (T value)
    {
    }
}
```

**Reason**: it is not possible to create an Objective-C
signature for the exported members that Objective-C code can
call, since the signature would differ depending on the exact
type of the generic type `T`.

**Good**:

```csharp
class Generic<T> : NSObject
{
    T storage;

    [Export ("myMethod:")]
    public void MyMethod (NSObject value)
    {
    }
}
```

**Reason**: it is possible to have unconstrained generic type
arguments as long as they do not take part of the exported
member signature.

**Good**:

```csharp
class Generic<T, U> : NSObject where T: NSObject
{
    [Export ("myMethod:")]
    public void MyMethod (T value)
    {
        Console.WriteLine (typeof (U));
    }
}
```

**Reason**: the `T` parameter in the Objective-C exported
`MyMethod` is constrained to be an `NSObject`, the unconstrained
type `U` is not part of the signature.

### Instantiations of Generic Types from Objective-C

Instantiation of generic types from Objective-C is not
allowed. This typically occurs when a managed type is used in
a xib or a storyboard.

Consider this class definition, which exposes a constructor
that takes an `IntPtr` (the Xamarin.iOS way of constructing a C#
object from a native Objective-C instance):

```csharp
class Generic<T> : NSObject where T : NSObject
{
    public Generic () {}
    public Generic (IntPtr ptr) : base (ptr) {}
}
```

While the above construct is fine, at runtime, this will
throw an exception at if Objective-C tries to create an
instance of it.

This is happens because Objective-C has no concept of
generic types, and it cannot specify the exact generic type
to create.

This problem can be worked around by creating a specialized
subclass of the generic type. For example:

```csharp
class Generic<T> : NSObject where T : NSObject
{
    public Generic () {}
    public Generic (IntPtr ptr) : base (ptr) {}
}

class GenericUIView : Generic<UIView>
{
}
```

Now there is no ambiguity anymore, the
class `GenericUIView` can be used in xibs or storyboards.

## No support for generic methods

### Generic methods are not allowed.

The following code will not compile:

```csharp
class MyClass : NSObject
{
    [Export ("myMethod")]
    public void MyMethod<T> (T argument)
    {
    }
}
```

**Reason**: This is not allowed because Xamarin.iOS does not
know which type to use for the type argument `T` when the method
is invoked from Objective-C .

An alternative is to create a specialized method and export that instead:

```csharp
class MyClass : NSObject
{
    [Export ("myMethod")]
    public void MyUIViewMethod (UIView argument)
    {
        MyMethod<UIView> (argument);
    }
    public void MyMethod<T> (T argument)
    {
    }
}
```

### No exported static members allowed

You can not expose a static members to Objective-C if it is
hosted inside a generic subclass of `NSObject`.

Example of an unsupported scenario:

```csharp
class Generic<T> : NSObject where T : NSObject
{
    [Export ("myMethod:")]
    public static void MyMethod ()
    {
    }

    [Export ("myProperty")]
    public static T MyProperty { get; set; }
}
```

**Reason:** Just like generic methods, the Xamarin.iOS runtime
needs to be able to know what type to use for the generic type
argument `T`.

For instance members the instance itself is used (since
there will never be an instance `Generic<T>`, it will
always be `Generic<SomeSpecificClass>`), but for static
members this information is not present.

Note that this applies even if the member in question does
not use the type argument `T` in any way.

The alternative in this case is to create a specialized subclass:

```csharp
class GenericUIView : Generic<UIView>
{
    [Export ("myUIViewMethod")]
    public static void MyUIViewMethod ()
    {
        MyMethod ();
    }

    [Export ("myProperty")]
    public static UIView MyUIViewProperty {
        get { return MyProperty; }
        set { MyProperty = value; }
    }
}

class Generic<T> : NSObject where T : NSObject
{
    public static void MyMethod () {}
    public static T MyProperty { get; set; }
}
```

## Performance

The static registrar can't resolve an exported member in a generic
type at build time as it usually does, it has to be looked up at
runtime. This means    that invoking such a method from Objective-C
is slightly slower than invoking members from non-generic classes.

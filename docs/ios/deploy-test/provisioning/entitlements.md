# Working with entitlements in Xamarin.iOS

_Entitlements are special app capabilities and security permissions granted to applications that are correctly configured to use them._

In iOS, apps run in a _sandbox_, which provides a set of rules that limit access between the application and certain system resources or user data. _Entitlements_ are used to request that the system expand the sandbox to give your app additional capabilities.

To extend the capabilities of your app, an entitlement must be provided in your app’s Entitlements.plist file. Only certain capabilities can be extended and these are listed in the [Working with Capabilities](~/ios/deploy-test/provisioning/capabilities/index.md) guide and described [below](#entitlement-key-reference). Entitlements are passed to the system as a Key/Value pair, and generally only one is required per capability. The specific Keys and Values are described in the [Entitlement key reference](#entitlement-key-reference) section later in this guide.
Visual Studio for Mac and Visual Studio provide a clear interface for adding entitlements in a Xamarin.iOS app through the Entitlements.plist editor.
This guide introduces the Entitlements.plist editor and how to use it. It also provides a reference of all the entitlements that can be added to an iOS project for each capability.

## Entitlements and provisioning

The Entitlements.plist file is used to specify entitlements and is used to sign the application bundle.

However, some additional provisioning is required to ensure that the app is code signed correctly. The provisioning profile used must contain an App ID that has the required capability enabled. For information on how to do this, refer to the [Working with Capabilities](~/ios/deploy-test/provisioning/capabilities/index.md) guide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Entitlements.plist file helps fill in the correct properties for an application using capabilities, but it can't generate a provisioning profile as it is not linked to an Apple developer account. You will still need to generate a provisioning profile using the developer portal to deploy and distribute the application.

## Set entitlements in a Xamarin.iOS project

In addition to selecting and configuring the required application services when defining the App ID, the entitlements must also be configured in the Xamarin.iOS project by editing the **Info.plist** and **Entitlements.plist** files.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/macos)

To configure the entitlements in Visual Studio for Mac, do the following:

1. In the **Solution pad**, double-click the **Info.plist** file to open it.
2. In the **Identity** section, fill in a name for the application and enter the **Bundle Identifier** that was created when the App ID was defined:

    ![Enter a Bundle Identifier](entitlements-images/servicexs01-sml.png)

3. Save the changes to the **Info.plist** file.
4. In the **Solution pad**, double-click the **Entitlements.plist** file to open it for editing:

    ![Editing the Entitlements](entitlements-images/servicexs02-sml.png)

5. Select and configure any entitlements required for the Xamarin.iOS application so that they match the setup that was defined when the App ID was created.
6. Save the changes to the **Entitlements.plist** file.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/windows)

To configure the entitlements in Visual Studio, do the following:

1. In the **Solution Explorer**, double-click the **Info.plist** to open it for editing.
2. In the **iOS Application Target** section, fill in a name for the application and enter the **Bundle Identifier** that was created when the App ID was defined:

    ![Setting the Bundle Identifier](entitlements-images/servicevs01-sml.png)

3. Save the changes to the **Info.plist** file.
4. In the **Solution Explorer**, double-click on the **Entitlements.plist** file to open it:

    ![Editing the Entitlements](entitlements-images/servicevs02-sml.png)

    You can also right-click the **Entitlements.plist** file and choose **Open with...** the XML Source editor which will allow you to set the Entitlement property and key value as detailed in the [Entitlement key Reference](#entitlement-key-reference) section below.

5. Select and configure any entitlements required for the Xamarin.iOS application so that they match the setup that was defined when the App ID was created.
6. Save the changes to the **Entitlements.plist** file.

## Adding a new Entitlements.plist file

Entitlements are added to an app via the Entitlements.plist file. This file is included in Xamarin.iOS projects by default but may be missing from older projects.

To add an Entitlements.plist file to your Xamarin.iOS do the following:

1. Right-click on the project file and browse to **Add > New File…**:

    ![Add Files context menu](entitlements-images/image1-sml.png)
2. In the New File dialog select **iOS > Property List** and name it Entitlements:

    ![New File dialog](entitlements-images/image2-sml.png)

## Entitlement key reference

Entitlement keys can be added via the Source panel of the Entitlements.plist editor. The required keys will normally be added when using the Entitlements.plist editor but are listed below for reference.

### Wallet

- **Description**: Formally known as Passbook, wallet is an app that stores and manages passes. These passes may be credit cards, store cards, boarding passes, or tickets.

  - **Pass Type Identifier**
    - **Keys**: com.apple.developer.pass-type-identifiers
    - **String**: `$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)*`

- **Notes**:
  - This will enable your app to allow all pass types. To restrict your app and only allow a subset of team pass types, set the string value to:
      `$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)pass.$(CFBundleIdentifier)`

  Where pass.$(CFBundleIdentifier) is the Pass ID that has been created [above](~/ios/platform/passkit.md)

### iCloud

- **Description**: iCloud provides iOS users with a convenient and simple way to store their content and share it between devices. There are four ways developers can use iCloud to provide a means of storage for their users: Key-Value storage, UIDocument Storage, CoreData, and using CloudKit directly to provide storage for Individual files and directories. For more information on these, refer to the Introduction to iCloud guide.

  - **iCloud Documents & CloudKit**
    - **Keys**: com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers
    - **String**: `$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)$(CFBundleIdentifier)`
  - **iCloud KeyValue Storage**
    - **Key**: com.apple.developer.ubiquity-kvstore-identifier
    - **String**: `$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)$(CFBundleIdentifier)`

- **Notes**:
  - The `$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)` string can be located by logging to developer.apple.com and visit the **Member Center > Your Account > Developer Account Summary** to get your Team ID (or Individual ID for single developers). It will be a 10 character string ( A93A5CM278 for example).
  - The `$(CFBundleIdentifier)` string begins with `iCloud` and is set when the iCloud container is crated as per the steps in the [Working with Capabilities](~/ios/deploy-test/provisioning/capabilities/icloud-capabilities.md) guide.
  - The $`(TeamIdentifierPrefix)` and `$(CFBundleIdentifier)` placeholders can be used and will be substituted for the correct values at build time.

  - **Key**: com.apple.developer.associated-domains
  - **String**: webcredentials:example.com

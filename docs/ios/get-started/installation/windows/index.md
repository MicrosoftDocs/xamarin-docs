# Installing Xamarin.iOS on Windows

_This article describes how to set up a Windows machine and a Mac build
host for Xamarin.iOS development._

::: zone pivot="windows"

## Overview

To build Xamarin.iOS apps with Visual Studio 2019 on Windows, you will need:

- A Windows machine with Visual Studio 2019 installed. This can be a physical
  or a virtual machine.

  - [Windows system requirements](~/cross-platform/get-started/requirements.md#windows-requirements)

- A network-accessible Mac set up with Apple's build tools
  and Xamarin.iOS. Visual Studio 2019 accesses this machine over a network
  connection to use Apple's build tools, which are required for compiling
  native iOS applications.

  - [Mac system requirements](~/cross-platform/get-started/requirements.md#macos-requirements)

  > [!TIP]
  > Don't have access to a Mac?
  >
  > If you do not have access to a Mac, you can use [MacinCloud](https://www.macincloud.com/pages/visual-studio-mac.html) or [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/); both services provide cloud-based Mac hardware that you can use to build Xamarin.iOS projects.

## Setup

To get set up for Xamarin.iOS development in Visual Studio 2019, follow
these steps:

1. Set up Windows (Install Visual Studio 2019)

    Xamarin.iOS works with Visual Studio 2019 Community, Professional,
    and Enterprise editions, on a standalone or virtual machine.

    - [Install Visual Studio 2019](~/get-started/installation/windows.md).

2. Set up Mac (Install Xcode and Visual Studio for Mac)

    To build, debug, and sign iOS applications for distribution, Visual
    Studio 2017 must have network access to a Mac build host configured
    with both Apple's developer tools (Xcode) and Xamarin.iOS.

    - [Download and install Xcode from the Mac App
      Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
    - [Install Visual Studio for
      Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/mac/installation), which
      also installs Xamarin.iOS.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you would prefer not to install Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2019 can
    > [automatically configure](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#automatic-macos-provisioning),
    > the Mac build host with the software necessary to build Xamarin.iOS applications.
    > For more information, see [Automatic Mac provisioning](~/ios/get-started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/index.md#automatic-mac-provisioning).

3. Pair to Mac (Connect Visual Studio 2019 to the Mac)

    For Visual Studio 2019 to use the iOS build tools on the Mac, the two
    machines must connect over a network.

    - [Read the Pair to Mac guide](~/ios/get-started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/index.md).

# Get Started with Xamarin.iOS

Xamarin.iOS allows developers to create native iOS applications using the same UI controls that are available in Objective-C and Xcode, except with the flexibility and elegance of a modern language (C#), the power of the .NET Base Class Library (BCL), and two first-class IDEs - Visual Studio for Mac and Visual Studio. This series introduces how to setup and install Xamarin.iOS and addresses the basics of Xamarin.iOS development.

## Required components

To build for Xamarin.iOS, the following are required:

- the latest version of Visual Studio
- the latest iOS SDK
- the latest version of Xcode
- the minimum version of macOS required by Xcode

For specific version requirements, refer to the [latest Xamarin.iOS release notes](/xamarin/ios/release-notes/).

The latest version of Xcode can be downloaded from the [iOS Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action#downloads) (login required), or via the Mac App Store:

### [Hello, iOS](~/ios/get-started/hello-ios/index.md)

This two-part guide teaches you how to build your first Xamarin.iOS application using Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio and introduces the fundamentals of iOS application development with Xamarin. This guide will also introduce the tools, concepts, and steps required to build and deploy a Xamarin.iOS application.

### [Hello, iOS Multiscreen](~/ios/get-started/hello-ios-multiscreen/index.md)

This two-part guide explores expanding the application created in the Hello, iOS guide to handle a second screen. It introduces concepts such as the Model-View-Controller design pattern, implementing iOS navigation, and developing a deeper understanding of iOS application structure and functionality.

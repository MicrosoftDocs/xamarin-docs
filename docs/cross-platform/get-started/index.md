- [iOS Quick Start](~/ios/get-started/hello-ios/hello-ios-quickstart.md)

## Getting Started with Mobile Development

To learn more about how Xamarin works, and how to approach mobile app development projects,
read the guides below:

### [Introduction to Mobile Development](~/cross-platform/get-started/introduction-to-mobile-development.md)

This document explains *how Xamarin works* at a high-level and links through to the getting-started guides for iOS, Android, and Xamarin.Forms.

### [Introduction to the Mobile Software Development Lifecycle](~/cross-platform/get-started/introduction-to-mobile-sdlc.md)

This article discusses the software development lifecycle with respect to mobile applications, and discusses some of the considerations required when building mobile projects. For developers wishing to just jump right in and start building, this guide can be skipped and read later for a more complete understanding of mobile development.

## [Building Cross Platform Applications](~/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/building-cross-platform-applications/index.md)

By choosing Xamarin and keeping a few things in mind when you design and
develop your mobile applications, you can realize tremendous code sharing across
mobile platforms, reduce your time to market, leverage existing talent, meet
customer demand for mobile access, and reduce cross-platform
complexity.&nbsp;This document outlines key guidelines to realizing these
advantages for utility and productivity applications.

# Using F# With Xamarin

F# is an open-source, cross-platform, functional-first programming
language for .NET.

F# combines the succinctness, expressivity, and composability of
type-inferred functional programming, the compile-time safety of
strongly-typed code, and the runtime support, libraries,
interoperability, tools, and object model of .NET.

F# is available as a programming language to Xamarin users on all of the
Xamarin-supported platforms: Android, macOS, and iOS.

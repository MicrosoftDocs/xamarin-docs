# HttpClient and SSL/TLS implementation selector for iOS/macOS

The **HttpClient Implementation Selector** for Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.tvOS, and Xamarin.Mac controls which `HttpClient` implementation to use. You can switch to an implementation that uses iOS, tvOS, or macOS native transports (`NSUrlSession` or `CFNetwork`, depending on the OS). The upside is TLS 1.2-support, smaller binaries, and faster downloads; the downside is that it requires the event loop to be running for async operations to be executed.

Projects must reference the **System.Net.Http** assembly.

> [!WARNING]
> **April, 2018** â€“ Due to increased security requirements, including PCI compliance, major cloud providers and web servers are expected to stop supporting TLS versions older than 1.2. Xamarin projects created in previous versions of Visual Studio default to use older versions of TLS.
>
> In order to ensure your apps continue to work with these servers and services, **you should update your Xamarin projects with the `NSUrlSession` setting shown below, then re-build and re-deploy your apps** to your users.

## Selecting an HttpClient stack

To adjust the `HttpClient` being used by your app:

1. Double-click the **Project Name** in the **Solution Explorer** to open the Project Options.
2. Switch to the **Build** settings for your project (for example, **iOS Build** for a Xamarin.iOS app).
3. From the **HttpClient Implementation** dropdown, select the `HttpClient` type as one of the following: **NSUrlSession** (recommended), **CFNetwork**, or **Managed**.

> [!TIP]
> For TLS 1.2 support the `NSUrlSession` option is recommended.

### NSUrlSession

The `NSURLSession`-based handler is based on the native `NSURLSession` framework available in iOS 7 and newer. 
**This is the recommended setting.**

#### Pros

- It uses native APIs for better performance and smaller executable size.
- Support for the latest standards such as TLS 1.2.

#### Cons

- Requires iOS 7 or later.
- Some `HttpClient` features/options are not available.

### CFNetwork

The `CFNetwork`-based handler is based on the native `CFNetwork` framework available in iOS 6 and newer.

#### Pros

- It uses native APIs for better performance and smaller executable size.
- Support for newer standards such as TLS 1.2.

#### Cons

- Requires iOS 6 or later.
- Not available on watchOS.
- Some HttpClient features/options are not available.

### Managed

The Managed handler is the fully managed HttpClient handler that has been shipped with previous version of Xamarin.

#### Pros

- It has the most compatible feature set with Microsoft .NET and older Xamarin versions.

#### Cons

- It is not fully integrated with the Apple OSes and is limited to TLS 1.0. It may not be able to connect to secure web servers or cloud services in the future.
- It typically much slower at things like encryption than the native APIs.
- It requires more managed code, thus creating a larger app distributable.

### Programmatically setting the HttpMessageHandler

In addition to the project-wide configuration shown above, you can also instantiate an `HttpClient` and inject the desired `HttpMessageHandler` through the constructor, as demonstrated in these code snippets:

```csharp
// This will use the default message handler for the application; as
// set in the Project Options for the project.
HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

// This will create an HttpClient that explicitly uses the CFNetworkHandler
HttpClient client = new HttpClient(new CFNetworkHandler());

// This will create an HttpClient that explicitly uses NSUrlSessionHandler
HttpClient client = new HttpClient(new NSUrlSessionHandler());
```

This makes it possible to use a different `HttpMessageHandler` from what is declared in the **Project Options** dialog.

## SSL/TLS implementation

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), provide support for HTTP and other network connections via `System.Net.Security.SslStream`. Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.tvOS or Xamarin.Mac's `System.Net.Security.SslStream` implementation will call Apple's native SSL/TLS implementation instead of using the managed implementation provided by Mono. Apple's native implementation supports TLS 1.2.

> [!WARNING]
> The upcoming Xamarin.Mac 4.8 release will only support macOS 10.9 or higher.
> Previous versions of Xamarin.Mac supported macOS 10.7 or higher, but
> these older macOS versions lack sufficient TLS infrastructure to support
> TLS 1.2. To target macOS 10.7 or macOS 10.8, use Xamarin.Mac 4.6 or 
> earlier.

## App Transport Security

Apple's _App Transport Security_ (ATS) enforces secure connections between internet resources (such as the app's back-end server) and your app. ATS ensures that all internet communications conform to secure connection best practices, thereby preventing accidental disclosure of sensitive information either directly through your app or a library that it is consuming.

Since ATS is enabled by default in apps built for iOS 9, tvOS 9 and OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and newer, all connections using `NSUrlConnection`, `CFUrl` or `NSUrlSession` will be subject to ATS security requirements. If your connections do not meet these requirements, they will fail with an exception.

Based on your HttpClient Stack and SSL/TLS Implementation selections, you may need to make modifications to your app to work correctly with ATS.

To find out more about ATS, please see our [App Transport Security guide](~/ios/app-fundamentals/ats.md).

## Known issues

This section will cover known issues with TLS support in Xamarin.iOS.

### Project failed to load with error "Requested value AppleTLS wasn't found"

Xamarin.iOS 9.8 introduced some new settings contained the **.csproj** file for a Xamarin.iOS application. These changes  may cause problems when the project is opened with older versions of Xamarin.iOS. The following screenshot is a example of the error message that may be displayed in this scenario:

![Screenshot of error while trying to load project, requested value legacy not found](http-stack-images/tlserror-xs.png)

This error is caused by the introduction of the `MtouchTlsProvider` setting to the project file in Xamarin.iOS 9.8. If it is not possible to update to Xamarin.iOS 9.8 (or higher), the work around is to manually edit the **.csproj** file  application, remove the `MtouchTlsprovider` element, and then save the  changed project file.

The following snippet is an example of what the `MtouchTlsProvider` setting may look like inside a **.csproj** file:

```xml
<MtouchTlsProvider>Default</MtouchTlsProvider>
```

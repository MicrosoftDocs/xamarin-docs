# Objective Sharpie Features

Read through these pages to better understand Objective Sharpie's features:

## [**ApiDefinitions.cs & StructsAndEnums.cs**](apidefinitions-structsandenums.md)

These two files are emitted by Objective Sharpie, to be included
in your binding project. Learn more about them [here](apidefinitions-structsandenums.md).

## [**Native Frameworks**](native-frameworks.md)

Some libraries are distributed as frameworks rather than as source.
Objective Sharpie lets you use these libraries with the `-framework` option.

## [**Verify**](verify.md)

Objective Sharpie add `Verify` attributes to signal that you need to
manually inspect and update the generated binding.

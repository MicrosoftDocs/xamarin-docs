# Real-World Example using CocoaPods


**This example uses the [AFNetworking CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/AFNetworking).**

New in version 3.0, Objective Sharpie supports binding CocoaPods, and even has a frontend command (`sharpie pod`) to make downloading, configuring, and building CocoaPods very easy. You should [faimilarize yourself with CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) in general before using this feature.

The `sharpie pod` command has one global option and two subcommands:

```csharp
$ sharpie pod -help
usage: sharpie pod [OPTIONS] COMMAND [COMMAND_OPTIONS]

Pod Options:
  -d, -dir DIR     Use DIR as the CocoaPods binding directory,
                   defaulting to the current directory

Available Commands:
  init         Initialize a new Xamarin C# CocoaPods binding project
  bind         Bind an existing Xamarin C# CocoaPods project
```

The `init` subcommand also has some useful help:

```csharp
$ sharpie pod init -help
usage: sharpie pod init [INIT_OPTIONS] TARGET_SDK POD_SPEC_NAMES

Init Options:
  -f, -force       Initialize a new Podfile and run actions against
                   it even if one already exists
```

Multiple CocoaPod names and subspec names can be provided to `init`.

<pre>$ <b>sharpie pod init ios AFNetworking</b>
<span class="terminal-green">**</span> Setting up CocoaPods master repo ...
   (this may take a while the first time)
<span class="terminal-green">**</span> Searching for requested CocoaPods ...
<span class="terminal-green">**</span> Working directory:
<span class="terminal-green">**</span>   - Writing Podfile ...
<span class="terminal-green">**</span>   - Installing CocoaPods ...
<span class="terminal-green">**</span>     (running `<span class="terminal-blue">pod install --no-integrate --no-repo-update</span>`)
Analyzing dependencies
Downloading dependencies
Installing AFNetworking (2.6.0)
Generating Pods project
Sending stats
<span class="terminal-green">**</span> 🍻 Success! You can now use other `<span class="terminal-green">sharpie pod</span>`  commands.</pre>

Once your CocoaPod has been set up, you can now create the binding:

<pre>$ <b>sharpie pod bind</b></pre>

This will result in the CocoaPod Xcode project being built and then evaluated and parsed by Objective Sharpie. A lot of console output will be generated, but should result in the binding definition at the end:

<pre><em>(... lots of build output ...)</em>

<span class="terminal-blue">Parsing 19 header files...</span>

<span class="terminal-magenta">Binding...</span>
  <span class="terminal-magenta">[write]</span> ApiDefinitions.cs
  <span class="terminal-magenta">[write]</span> StructsAndEnums.cs

<span class="terminal-green">Done.</span></pre>

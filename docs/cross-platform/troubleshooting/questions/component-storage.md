# Where are the components stored on my machine?

Whenever you install a Xamarin component into an App project, it gets placed in two places:

1. In a Components folder at the root level of your Solution folder. If you remove the Component from all projects in the solution, it will get removed from this folder as well.

2. A copy is also stored in the following locations:
    - Windows: `%LocalAppData%\Xamarin\Cache\Components`
    - Mac: `~/Library/Caches/Xamarin/Components`

So to remove a component completely from your system, delete it from your projects/solutions and from the cache folder above.

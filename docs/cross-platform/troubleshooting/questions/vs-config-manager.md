# Why doesn't Visual Studio include my referenced library project in my build?

Visual Studio uses the **Configuration Manager** to determine which projects in a solution are automatically included in a given build or deployment configuration.

Some templates that are generated with a referenced library project will already have the referenced library included in the configuration; but otherwise it will need to be set manually.

## How to use the Configuration Manager

1. Open **Build > Configuration Manager**
2. Select the configuration to customize, e.g. **Debug | iPhone**
3. Select checkboxes for the projects you wish to include.

> [!NOTE]
> Greyed out boxes are handled automatically, and shouldn't need any changes.

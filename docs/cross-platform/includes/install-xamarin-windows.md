Xamarin can be installed as part of a _new_ Visual Studio 2017 installation, with the following steps:

1. Download Visual Studio 2017 Community, Visual Studio Professional, or
   Visual Studio Enterprise from the
   [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) page (download
   links are provided at the bottom).

2. Double-click the downloaded package to start installation.

3. Select the **Mobile development with .NET** workload from the
   installation screen:

4. While **Mobile development with .NET** is selected, have a look at
   the **Installation details** panel on the right. Here, you can deselect
   mobile development options that you do not want to install.

   **Install** button in the lower right-hand corner:

   Depending on which edition of Visual Studio 2017 you are installing, the
   installation process can take a long time to complete. You can use
   the progress bars to monitor the installation:

   button to start Visual Studio:

### Adding Xamarin to Visual Studio 2017

If Visual Studio 2017 is already installed, add Xamarin by
re-running the Visual Studio 2017 installer to modify workloads (see
[Modify Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/modify-visual-studio)
for details). Next, follow the steps listed above to install Xamarin.

For more information about downloading and installing Visual Studio
2017, see [Install Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio).

# Xamarin mobile apps with Azure and App Center

Xamarin developers can take advantage of a wide variety of cloud services, from continuous integration build with App Center to machine learning with Azure. [Download this poster](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/guides/cross-platform/azure/Resources/poster.pdf) or follow the links below to learn more.

## App Center

Visual Studio App Center supports end to end and integrated services central to mobile app development. Developers can use **Build**, **Test** and **Distribute** services to set up a Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline. Once the app is deployed, developers can monitor the status and usage of their app using the **Analytics** and **Diagnostics** services, and engage with users using the **Push** service. Developers can also leverage **Auth** to authenticate their users and the **Data** service to persist and sync app data in the cloud.

If you are looking to integrate cloud services in your Xamarin apps, [visit the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter) and sign up with [App Center](https://appcenter.ms/signup?utm_source=XamarinDocs&utm_medium=Azure&utm_campaign=docs) today.

## Azure

# Microsoft Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory allows developers to secure
  resources such as files, links, and Web APIs,
  Office 365, and more
  using the same organizational account that
  employees use to sign in to their systems or check their emails.

## Getting Started

Follow the [getting started instructions](~/cross-platform/data-cloud/active-directory/get-started/index.md)
  to configure the Azure portal and add Active Directory authentication
  to your Xamarin apps.

1. [Registering with Azure Active Directory](~/cross-platform/data-cloud/active-directory/get-started/register.md) on the *windowsazure.com* portal, then
2. [Configure services](~/cross-platform/data-cloud/active-directory/get-started/configure.md).
3. Hook up one of the following:

## Office 365

Once you have added Active Directory authentication
  to an app, you can also use the credentials to
  interact with Office 365.

## Graph API

Learn how to access the [Graph API](~/cross-platform/data-cloud/active-directory/graph.md)
  using Xamarin (also covered in our [blog](https://blog.xamarin.com/authenticate-xamarin-mobile-apps-using-azure-active-directory/)).

# Deployment & Debugging

## [Connect to Local Web Services](connect-to-local-web-services.md)

Applications running in the iOS simulator or Android emulator can consume local web services that are exposed over HTTP or HTTPS.

## [Custom Linker Configuration](linker.md)

If the default set of options is not enough, you can drive the linking process with an XML file that describes what you want from the linker.

## [Multi-Process Debugging](multi-process-debugging.md)

This guide discusses how to debug multiple processes.

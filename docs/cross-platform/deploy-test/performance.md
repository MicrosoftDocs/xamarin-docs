# Performance and Security

## [Cross-Platform Performance](memory-perf-best-practices.md)

There are many techniques for increasing the performance of applications built with the Xamarin platform. Collectively these techniques can greatly reduce the amount of work being performed by a CPU, and the amount of memory consumed by an application.

- [Android Performance](~/android/deploy-test/performance.md?context=xamarin/cross-platform)
- [iOS Performance](~/ios/deploy-test/performance.md?context=xamarin/cross-platform)
- [Mac Performance](~/mac/deploy-test/performance.md?context=xamarin/cross-platform)

## [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](~/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/transport-layer-security.md)

Ensure your apps are using recommended security settings, such as TLS 1.2.

- [Android](~/android/app-fundamentals/http-stack.md?context=xamarin/cross-platform)
- [iOS and Mac](~/cross-platform/macios/http-stack.md?context=xamarin/cross-platform)

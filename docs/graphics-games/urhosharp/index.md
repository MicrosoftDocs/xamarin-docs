# UrhoSharp - 3D/2D Engine

_UrhoSharp is a cross-platform high-level 3D and 2D engine that can be used to create animated 3D and 2D scenes for your applications using geometries, materials, lights, and cameras._

UrhoSharp is distributed as a NuGet package that can be installed on
either Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac and can be
used to target any of the following platforms: Android, MacOS, iOS, tvOS and Windows.

## [Introduction to UrhoSharp](~/graphics-games/urhosharp/introduction.md)

This article provides a high-level overview of UrhoSharp and its
capabilities for 3D visualization and for use in simple 3D games.

## [Using UrhoSharp](~/graphics-games/urhosharp/using.md)

In this document we describe the core concepts of UrhoSharp that you
would use to build a game or create a 3D visualization for your
application.

## [Urho and your platform](~/graphics-games/urhosharp/platform/index.md)

These guides describe the setup instructions for Urho on each target
platform and describe ways to integrate Urho with your existing
Android and iOS applications.

## [Programming UrhoSharp with F#](~/graphics-games/urhosharp/fsharp.md)

This guide walks through the creation of a simple "Hello, World!" UrhoSharp solution using F# and Visual Studio for Mac.

## Samples

We have created [samples on GitHub](https://github.com/xamarin/urho-samples) illustrating how to
use UrhoSharp.

- **FeatureSamples** shows more than 40 individual samples that showcase specific features of Urho.

- **SamplyGame** is a sample implementation of the Shooty Skies game.

- **FormsSample** showcases how to use UrhoSharp in Xamarin.Forms applications.

All the samples run on Android, iOS, Mac and Windows.

# 2D drawing With SkiaSharp

SkiaSharp provides a powerful C# API for doing 2D graphics. It is
powered by [Google’s Skia library](http://skia.org), the
same library that powers Google Chrome, Firefox and Android’s graphic
stacks.

SkiaSharp is a Portable Library, and ships conveniently as a
[cross-platform NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp),
and supports the following platforms out of the box:
macOS, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, and the Windows Desktop.

## Work in Progress

SkiaSharp is a work in progress that we are sharing with our
community. While we have bound important parts of the Skia API, much
work remains to be done. We are using the stable C API surfaced by
Skia, and our plan is to continue contributing our work to the C
bindings of Skia to provide full coverage to the APIs.

To help us guide our binding efforts, please leave comments or
suggestions as issues on the GitHub repository
[https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp).
